{"Problem: Kevin Kangaroo begins hopping on a number line at 0. He wants to get to 1, but he can hop only $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the distance. Each hop tires him out so that he continues to hop $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the remaining distance. How far has he hopped after five hops? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nAnswer: Let's think step by step\nKevin hops $1/3$ of the remaining distance with every hop.\nHis first hop takes $1/3$ closer.\nFor his second hop, he has $2/3$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)(1/3)$.\nFor his third hop, he has $(2/3)^2$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)^2(1/3)$.\nIn general, Kevin hops forward $(2/3)^{k-1}(1/3)$ on his $k$th hop.\nWe want to find how far he has hopped after five hops.\nThis is a finite geometric series with first term $1/3$, common ratio $2/3$, and five terms.\nThus, Kevin has hopped $\\frac{\\frac{1}{3}\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5\\right)}{1-\\frac{2}{3}} = \\boxed{\\frac{211}{243}}$.\nThe answer is \\frac{211}{243}}\n\nProblem: What is the area of the region defined by the equation $x^2+y^2 - 7 = 4y-14x+3$?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step\nWe rewrite the equation as $x^2 + 14x + y^2 - 4y = 10$ and then complete the square,\nresulting in  $(x+7)^2-49 + (y-2)^2-4=10$,\nor $(x+7)^2+(y-2)^2=63$.\nThis is the equation of a circle with center $(-7, 2)$ and radius $\\sqrt{63},$\nso the area of this region is $\\pi r^2 = \\boxed{63\\pi}$.\nThe answer is 63\\pi\n\nProblem: If $x^2+y^2=1$, what is the largest possible value of $|x|+|y|$?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step\nIf $(x,y)$ lies on the circle,\nso does $(x,-y),$ $(-x,-y),$ and $(-x,-y),$ (which all give the same value of $|x| + |y|$),\nso we can assume that $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0.$\nThen $|x| + |y| = x + y.$  Squaring, we get\n\\[(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1 + 2xy.\\]\nNote that $(x - y)^2 \\ge 0.$\nExpanding, we get $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \\ge 0,$ so $2xy \\le x^2 + y^2 = 1.$\nHence,\\[1 + 2xy \\le 2,\\]which means $x + y \\le \\sqrt{2}.$\nEquality occurs when $x = y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}},$\nso the maximum value of $|x| + |y|$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}}.$\nThe answer is \\sqrt{2}\n\nProblem: If $f(x)=\\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}, abcd\\not=0$ and $f(f(x))=x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$, what is the value of $a+d$?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step\nThe condition $f(f(x))$ means that $f$ is the inverse of itself,\nso its graph is symmetrical about the line $y = x$.\nWith a rational function of this form, we will have two asymptotes:\na vertical one at $x=-d/c$ if $cx+d$ does not divide $ax+b$,\nand a horizontal one at $y=a/c$,\nif we take the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ goes to $\\pm\\infty$.\nIn order for $f$ to be its own inverse, the intersection of the asymptotes must lie on the line $y=x$\nso that it and its asymptotes reflect onto themselves.\nThis means that $-d/c=a/c$,\nand therefore $-d=a$ and $a+d=\\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is 0\n\nProblem: A math teacher requires Noelle to do one homework assignment for each of the first five homework points she wants to earn; for each of the next five homework points, she needs to do two homework assignments; and so on, so that to earn the $n^{\\text{th}}$ homework point, she has to do $n\\div5$ (rounded up) homework assignments.

Express your answer as a common fraction.\nAnswer: Let's think step by step\nKevin hops $1/3$ of the remaining distance with every hop.\nHis first hop takes $1/3$ closer.\nFor his second hop, he has $2/3$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)(1/3)$.\nFor his third hop, he has $(2/3)^2$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)^2(1/3)$.\nIn general, Kevin hops forward $(2/3)^{k-1}(1/3)$ on his $k$th hop.\nWe want to find how far he has hopped after five hops.\nThis is a finite geometric series with first term $1/3$, common ratio $2/3$, and five terms.\nThus, Kevin has hopped $\\frac{\\frac{1}{3}\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5\\right)}{1-\\frac{2}{3}} = \\boxed{\\frac{211}{243}}$.\nThe answer is \\frac{211}{243}}\n\nProblem: What is the area of the region defined by the equation $x^2+y^2 - 7 = 4y-14x+3$?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step\nWe rewrite the equation as $x^2 + 14x + y^2 - 4y = 10$ and then complete the square,\nresulting in  $(x+7)^2-49 + (y-2)^2-4=10$,\nor $(x+7)^2+(y-2)^2=63$.\nThis is the equation of a circle with center $(-7, 2)$ and radius $\\sqrt{63},$\nso the area of this region is $\\pi r^2 = \\boxed{63\\pi}$.\nThe answer is 63\\pi\n\nProblem: If $x^2+y^2=1$, what is the largest possible value of $|x|+|y|$?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step\nIf $(x,y)$ lies on the circle,\nso does $(x,-y),$ $(-x,-y),$ and $(-x,-y),$ (which all give the same value of $|x| + |y|$),\nso we can assume that $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0.$\nThen $|x| + |y| = x + y.$  Squaring, we get\n\\[(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1 + 2xy.\\]\nNote that $(x - y)^2 \\ge 0.$\nExpanding, we get $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \\ge 0,$ so $2xy \\le x^2 + y^2 = 1.$\nHence,\\[1 + 2xy \\le 2,\\]which means $x + y \\le \\sqrt{2}.$\nEquality occurs when $x = y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}},$\nso the maximum value of $|x| + |y|$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}}.$\nThe answer is \\sqrt{2}\n\nProblem: If $f(x)=\\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}, abcd\\not=0$ and $f(f(x))=x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$, what is the value of $a+d$?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step\nThe condition $f(f(x))$ means that $f$ is the inverse of itself,\nso its graph is symmetrical about the line $y = x$.\nWith a rational function of this form, we will have two asymptotes:\na vertical one at $x=-d/c$ if $cx+d$ does not divide $ax+b$,\nand a horizontal one at $y=a/c$,\nif we take the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ goes to $\\pm\\infty$.\nIn order for $f$ to be its own inverse, the intersection of the asymptotes must lie on the line $y=x$\nso that it and its asymptotes reflect onto themselves.\nThis means that $-d/c=a/c$,\nand therefore $-d=a$ and $a+d=\\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is 0\n\nProblem: A math teacher requires Noelle to do one homework assignment for each of the first five homework points she wants to earn; for each of the next five homework points, she needs to do two homework assignments; and so on, so that to earn the $n^{\\text{th}}$ homework point, she has to do $n\\div5$ (rounded up) homework assignments.

How far has he hopped after five hops? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nAnswer: Let's think step by step\nKevin hops $1/3$ of the remaining distance with every hop.\nHis first hop takes $1/3$ closer.\nFor his second hop, he has $2/3$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)(1/3)$.\nFor his third hop, he has $(2/3)^2$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)^2(1/3)$.\nIn general, Kevin hops forward $(2/3)^{k-1}(1/3)$ on his $k$th hop.\nWe want to find how far he has hopped after five hops.\nThis is a finite geometric series with first term $1/3$, common ratio $2/3$, and five terms.\nThus, Kevin has hopped $\\frac{\\frac{1}{3}\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5\\right)}{1-\\frac{2}{3}} = \\boxed{\\frac{211}{243}}$.\nThe answer is \\frac{211}{243}}\n\nProblem: What is the area of the region defined by the equation $x^2+y^2 - 7 = 4y-14x+3$?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step\nWe rewrite the equation as $x^2 + 14x + y^2 - 4y = 10$ and then complete the square,\nresulting in  $(x+7)^2-49 + (y-2)^2-4=10$,\nor $(x+7)^2+(y-2)^2=63$.\nThis is the equation of a circle with center $(-7, 2)$ and radius $\\sqrt{63},$\nso the area of this region is $\\pi r^2 = \\boxed{63\\pi}$.\nThe answer is 63\\pi\n\nProblem: If $x^2+y^2=1$, what is the largest possible value of $|x|+|y|$?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step\nIf $(x,y)$ lies on the circle,\nso does $(x,-y),$ $(-x,-y),$ and $(-x,-y),$ (which all give the same value of $|x| + |y|$),\nso we can assume that $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0.$\nThen $|x| + |y| = x + y.$  Squaring, we get\n\\[(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1 + 2xy.\\]\nNote that $(x - y)^2 \\ge 0.$\nExpanding, we get $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \\ge 0,$ so $2xy \\le x^2 + y^2 = 1.$\nHence,\\[1 + 2xy \\le 2,\\]which means $x + y \\le \\sqrt{2}.$\nEquality occurs when $x = y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}},$\nso the maximum value of $|x| + |y|$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}}.$\nThe answer is \\sqrt{2}\n\nProblem: If $f(x)=\\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}, abcd\\not=0$ and $f(f(x))=x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$, what is the value of $a+d$?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step\nThe condition $f(f(x))$ means that $f$ is the inverse of itself,\nso its graph is symmetrical about the line $y = x$.\nWith a rational function of this form, we will have two asymptotes:\na vertical one at $x=-d/c$ if $cx+d$ does not divide $ax+b$,\nand a horizontal one at $y=a/c$,\nif we take the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ goes to $\\pm\\infty$.\nIn order for $f$ to be its own inverse, the intersection of the asymptotes must lie on the line $y=x$\nso that it and its asymptotes reflect onto themselves.\nThis means that $-d/c=a/c$,\nand therefore $-d=a$ and $a+d=\\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is 0\n\nProblem: A math teacher requires Noelle to do one homework assignment for each of the first five homework points she wants to earn; for each of the next five homework points, she needs to do two homework assignments; and so on, so that to earn the $n^{\\text{th}}$ homework point, she has to do $n\\div5$ (rounded up) homework assignments.

He wants to get to 1, but he can hop only $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the distance. Each hop tires him out so that he continues to hop $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the remaining distance. How far has he hopped after five hops? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nAnswer: Let's think step by step\nKevin hops $1/3$ of the remaining distance with every hop.\nHis first hop takes $1/3$ closer.\nFor his second hop, he has $2/3$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)(1/3)$.\nFor his third hop, he has $(2/3)^2$ left to travel, so he hops forward $(2/3)^2(1/3)$.\nIn general, Kevin hops forward $(2/3)^{k-1}(1/3)$ on his $k$th hop.\nWe want to find how far he has hopped after five hops.\nThis is a finite geometric series with first term $1/3$, common ratio $2/3$, and five terms.\nThus, Kevin has hopped $\\frac{\\frac{1}{3}\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5\\right)}{1-\\frac{2}{3}} = \\boxed{\\frac{211}{243}}$.\nThe answer is \\frac{211}{243}}\n\nProblem: What is the area of the region defined by the equation $x^2+y^2 - 7 = 4y-14x+3$?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step\nWe rewrite the equation as $x^2 + 14x + y^2 - 4y = 10$ and then complete the square,\nresulting in  $(x+7)^2-49 + (y-2)^2-4=10$,\nor $(x+7)^2+(y-2)^2=63$.\nThis is the equation of a circle with center $(-7, 2)$ and radius $\\sqrt{63},$\nso the area of this region is $\\pi r^2 = \\boxed{63\\pi}$.\nThe answer is 63\\pi\n\nProblem: If $x^2+y^2=1$, what is the largest possible value of $|x|+|y|$?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step\nIf $(x,y)$ lies on the circle,\nso does $(x,-y),$ $(-x,-y),$ and $(-x,-y),$ (which all give the same value of $|x| + |y|$),\nso we can assume that $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0.$\nThen $|x| + |y| = x + y.$  Squaring, we get\n\\[(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 1 + 2xy.\\]\nNote that $(x - y)^2 \\ge 0.$\nExpanding, we get $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \\ge 0,$ so $2xy \\le x^2 + y^2 = 1.$\nHence,\\[1 + 2xy \\le 2,\\]which means $x + y \\le \\sqrt{2}.$\nEquality occurs when $x = y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}},$\nso the maximum value of $|x| + |y|$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}}.$\nThe answer is \\sqrt{2}\n\nProblem: If $f(x)=\\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}, abcd\\not=0$ and $f(f(x))=x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$, what is the value of $a+d$?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step\nThe condition $f(f(x))$ means that $f$ is the inverse of itself,\nso its graph is symmetrical about the line $y = x$.\nWith a rational function of this form, we will have two asymptotes:\na vertical one at $x=-d/c$ if $cx+d$ does not divide $ax+b$,\nand a horizontal one at $y=a/c$,\nif we take the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ goes to $\\pm\\infty$.\nIn order for $f$ to be its own inverse, the intersection of the asymptotes must lie on the line $y=x$\nso that it and its asymptotes reflect onto themselves.\nThis means that $-d/c=a/c$,\nand therefore $-d=a$ and $a+d=\\boxed{0}$.\nThe answer is 0\n\nProblem: A math teacher requires Noelle to do one homework assignment for each of the first five homework points she wants to earn; for each of the next five homework points, she needs to do two homework assignments; and so on, so that to earn the $n^{\\text{th}}$ homework point, she has to do $n\\div5$ (rounded up) homework assignments.

What is the smallest number of homework assignments necessary to earn a total of 25 homework points?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step\nNoelle only has to do 1 homework assignment to earn her first point,\nand the same is true for each of her first five points.\nShe must then do 2 homework assignments to earn her sixth point, seventh point, and so on, up to her tenth point.\nContinuing, we see that Noelle must do a total of \\[1+1+1+1+1+2+2+2+2+2+\\dots+5+5+5+5+5\\] homework assignments to earn 25 points.\nThis sum may be rewritten as $5(1+2+3+4+5)=5(15)=\\boxed{75}$.\nThe answer is 75\n\nProblem: The quadratic equation $x^2+mx+n=0$ has roots that are twice those of $x^2+px+m=0,$ and none of $m,$ $n,$ and $p$ is zero.

This means that for Match to break even, they must sell each unit for at least $110.\n\nHowever, this special order from Reno presents a different scenario. Since there would be no shipping costs associated with this order, Match's variable costs per unit would only consist of direct materials, direct labor, and variable overhead, which total to $110 per unit. \n\nOn top of that, Match will receive additional revenue from selling the 5000 units to Reno: 5000 units x $200 per unit = $1,000,000. However, there will also be a licensing fee of $50,000 that will come out of the additional revenue, leaving Match with a net additional revenue of $950,000.\n\nTo determine the lowest price at which Match should sell the 5000 units to Reno while maintaining their regular profit margin, we need to calculate the contribution margin per unit: \nSelling price per unit - Variable costs per unit = $200 - $110 = $90.\n\nSince we know Match's regular unit cost and contribution margin, we can calculate the minimum acceptable price Match should sell the 5000 units to Reno:\nMinimum acceptable price per unit = Variable costs per unit + (Net additional revenue / Number of units) = $110 + ($950,000 / 5000) = $300.\n\nSince the minimum acceptable price per unit is lower than the selling price of the regular production, Match should be willing to sell the 5000 units to Reno at the regular selling price of $200 per unit.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 200.", "Taking into account the given information, we can arrive at the following answer. \n\nWe need to calculate the total cost per unit of production.

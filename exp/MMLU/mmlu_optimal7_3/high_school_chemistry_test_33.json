This statement is false. The average speed of gas molecules depends on the temperature of the gas, which is the same for all three containers.

Therefore, the average speed of the molecules will not be the same in all three containers.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is (A).", "(B) The number of molecules in all the containers is the same.\n\nExplanation:\n\n(A) The densities increase in the order helium < nitrogen < carbon dioxide. This statement is false. The densities depend on both mass and volume. Since the containers are the same size, the densities depend only on the mass. We can calculate the densities:\n\nFor Helium: Density = 4.0 g / volume (same for all 3 containers)\nFor Nitrogen: Density = 28.0 g / volume (same for all 3 containers)\nFor CO2: Density = 44.0 g / volume (same for all 3 containers).\n\nSo, the statement (A) is wrong. \n\n(B) The number of molecules in all the containers is the same. This statement is false because the number of molecules of a gas depends on the amount (in moles) of the gas present. We can calculate the number of moles of each gas:\n\nFor Helium: moles = 4.0 g / 4.003 g/mol = 0.9997 mol\nFor Nitrogen: moles = 28.0 g / 28.0134 g/mol = 0.9985 mol\nFor CO2: moles = 44.0 g / 44.010 g/mol = 0.9990 mol\n\nThus, the number of molecules is different for each container. \n\n(C) The pressure in all three containers is the same. This statement is true. At the same temperature and volume, the pressure of a gas depends only on the number of molecules present. We can calculate the pressure using the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nwhere P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature. Since all three containers have the same volume and temperature, the pressure will be proportional to the number of moles present. From the calculations in the previous section, we see that all three containers have the same number of moles, and therefore, the same pressure. \n\n(D) The average speed of all the molecules is not the same. This statement is false. The average speed of a gas molecule depends on its molar mass and the temperature of the gas.

This statement is false. \n\nExplanation: The density of a gas depends on its mass and volume. The mass of gas in each container is different, but the containers are the same size and at the same temperature, so their volumes are the same. Therefore, the density of each gas depends only on its mass. The densities of the gases can be calculated using the formula density = mass/volume. \n\nFor helium: density = 4.0 g / volume (same as the other containers)\nFor nitrogen: density = 28.0 g / volume (same as the other containers)\nFor carbon dioxide: density = 44.0 g / volume (same as the other containers)\n\nSo the densities are the same for all three gases. \n\nB) The number of molecules in all the containers is NOT the same. \n\nExplanation: The number of molecules in a gas is proportional to its mass, but also depends on its molar mass. The molar mass of helium is 4.0 g/mol, and Avogadro's number tells us that there are about 6.02 x 10^23 molecules in one mole of a substance. Therefore, the number of molecules of helium is about 6.02 x 10^23 x (4.0 g / 4.0 g/mol) = 6.02 x 10^23. \n\nUsing the same calculation, the number of molecules in nitrogen is about 6.02 x 10^23 x (28.0 g / 28.0 g/mol) = 6.02 x 10^23. \nAnd the number of molecules in carbon dioxide is about 6.02 x 10^23 x (44.0 g / 44.0 g/mol) = 6.02 x 10^23. \n\nSo the number of molecules is the same for all three containers. Answer (B) is false. \n\nC) The pressure in all three containers is the same. This statement is probably true. \n\nExplanation: The ideal gas law states that pressure, volume, temperature, and number of particles in a gas are related through PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of particles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature. Since the containers are all the same size and at the same temperature, the only factor that could vary the pressure is the number of particles. \n\nFrom part (B), we know that the number of particles is the same for all three containers. Therefore, the pressure in each container should be the same as well. In other words, the pressure depends only on the number of particles in each container, and is not affected by the identity of the gas. Thus, statement (C) is true. \n\nD) The average speed of all the molecules is NOT the same. \n\nExplanation: The average speed of a gas molecule is related to its temperature and molar mass. The higher the temperature, the faster the molecules move on average. The lighter the molecule (i.e. the smaller its molar mass), the faster it moves on average at a given temperature. \n\nUsing the formula for root-mean-square speed (RMS), v(RMS) = sqrt(3RT/M), where v(RMS) is the RMS speed, R is the gas constant, T is temperature, and M is molar mass, we can calculate the average speed for each gas. \n\nFor helium: v(RMS) = sqrt(3 x 1 atm x 273 K / 4.0 g/mol) = 1,927 m/s\nFor nitrogen: v(RMS) = sqrt(3 x 1 atm x 273 K / 28.0 g/mol) = 515 m/s\nFor carbon dioxide: v(RMS) = sqrt(3 x 1 atm x 273 K / 44.0 g/mol) = 447 m/s\n\nThus, answer (D) is false.", "Based on the given information, the following are the explanations and justifications for each statement:\n\n(A) The densities increase in order helium < nitrogen < carbon dioxide.\nAnswer: False. \n\nDensity is the mass of a substance per unit volume.

Hence, the density does not increase in the order given; instead, it decreases in that order. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).\n\n(B) The number of molecules in all the containers is the same.\nAnswer: False.\n\nThe number of molecules of gas in each container depends on the amount of gas present and the type of gas. The amount of gas in each container is different, as given in the question. Thus, the number of the molecules of gas in each container will also be different. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).\n\n(C) The pressure in all three containers is the same.\nAnswer: True.\n\nSince all three containers are of the same size and are at the same temperature, the weight of the gas in each container will be different but the volume and temperature will be the same. Therefore, the number of gas molecules in each container will be different from each other. As per the universal gas equation, PV = nRT, the pressure is directly proportional to the number of gas molecules and the temperature, so the pressure will be the same for all the containers. Thus, the correct answer is (C).\n\n(D) The average speed of all the molecules is the same.\nAnswer: False.\n\nThe average speed of gas molecules depends on temperature and the mass of the molecule, among other things, based on the kinetic gas theory.

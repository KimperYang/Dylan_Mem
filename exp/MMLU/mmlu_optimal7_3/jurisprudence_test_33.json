Wade is highly controversial because the majority held that the abortion law of Texas was unconstitutional because it violated a woman's right to privacy. The case was based on the Fourteenth Amendment and the Supreme Court ruled that a woman has a constitutional right to privacy, which includes the right to make her own medical decisions, including the decision to have an abortion. This decision has been extremely controversial because it touches on deeply held beliefs about the limitations of government power, the morality of abortion, and the status of the fetus. Additionally, opponents argue that the court overstepped its bounds by creating a constitutional right to abortion. However, supporters of Roe v. Wade argue that the decision protected a woman's fundamental right to control her own body and make her own decisions about her health.\n\nTherefore, the accurate answer to the question is (C).", null, null], ["The United States Supreme Court's decision in Roe v Wade is highly controversial because the majority held that the abortion law of Texas was unconstitutional because it violated a woman's right to privacy.

[["Choice D is the least consistent with the argument that judges in an unjust legal system ought to resign. Judges may not make the law, but they are responsible for upholding it. If they are aware that a particular law is unjust, they have a duty to refuse to enforce it, and if they can no longer do their job to the best of their abilities in a legal system they believe to be unjust, they should resign.

The sum of these square factors is $4+12+20+60+9=105$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) none of the above. \n\nAgent solution 1: The agent correctly factors $1200$ and determines the possible values of $n$.

The perfect squares that are factors of 1200 will have exponents of 2 that are no larger than 2 for 2, 1 for 3, and 2 for 5 in their prime factorization. Thus, we can form the possible values of $n$ by multiplying powers of $2, 3, 5$ respectively such that the exponents of each prime is even.\n\n\n\\begin{align*}\nn &= 2^0 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 5^0 = 1\\\\\nn &= 2^2 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 5^0 = 4\\\\\nn &= 2^4 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 5^0 = 16\\\\\nn &= 2^0 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 5^2 = 25\\\\\nn &= 2^2 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 5^2 = 100\\\\\nn &= 2^4 \\cdot 3^0 \\cdot 5^2 = 400\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus, the sum is $1 + 4 + 16 + 25 + 100 + 400 = 546$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) none of the above.

Also, since the maximum amplitude is 15-9 = 6 feet, we have A = 6.\n\nThe period of the function is 12 hours (since the tides complete one cycle every 12 hours), which means the frequency is B = (2\u03c0/12) = \u03c0/6. We can find the phase shift by noting that the high tide occurred at 8 A.M., which is 4 hours after midnight (when the function passes through its minimum value).

Alternatively, we can use the fact that `B` must be between `\u03c0/12` and `\u03c0/6` (since the period of the sine function must be between 4 and 8 hours), and test values of `B` within that range until we find one that satisfies the equation above.

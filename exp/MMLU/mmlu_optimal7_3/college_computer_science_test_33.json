[["First, let me explain the conventional semantics of a stack. A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

[["When using write-allocation, the decision between write-back and write-through significantly affects the hit ratio in the cache memory. Write-back is advantageous when there is a locality of reference, i.e., frequently accessed cache lines become dirty and can be written back to main memory in a single operation. Hence, write-back allows for a smaller percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation, as compared to write-through. This leads to a better hit ratio, as fewer cache lines need to be evicted. Thus, option (A) is true. Therefore, the answer is (A).", null, null], ["The question asks about the impact of write policies on cache hit ratio under the assumption that write-allocation is always used.

Write-back policy waits to update the main memory until a cache line is evicted but it increases the complexity of maintaining consistency between cache and main memory. \n\nConsidering the above, write-back usually results in a better hit ratio than write-through because it minimizes main memory traffic by delaying the writes to main memory until a cache line is evicted.

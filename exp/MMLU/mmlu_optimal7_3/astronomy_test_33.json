Therefore, the answer is (C).\n\nAgent solution 1: Score 5 - The explanation is concise, accurate, and matches current scientific understanding.\n\nAgent solution 2: Score 4 - Although it provides helpful information regarding tectonic movements and identifies Earth as the only known planet currently exhibiting plate tectonics, it lacks information about other planets.\n\nAgent solution 3: Score 2 - The answer is not based on current scientific understanding, and it is not accurate to assume that active plate tectonics only refer to the movement of the Earth's lithosphere.\n\nOverall score: [[5, 4, 2]].\n\nMy answer: (C)."]]
[["According to the Solar Nebular theory, asteroids and comets are leftover planetesimals that never accreted into planets.

The Solar Nebular theory proposes that the solar system began as a rotating cloud of gas and dust, and over time, this material accreted (meaning it grew larger) through collisions to form the planets and moons. However, not all of the materials in the cloud were able to accrete into larger bodies. These leftover planetesimals, made of rock and ice, became the asteroids and comets that we see today. Option (A) is incorrect because collisions between planets are not believed to be the source of asteroids and comets.

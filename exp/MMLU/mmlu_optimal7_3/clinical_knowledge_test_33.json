The process of beta-oxidation breaks down fatty acids into acetyl-CoA molecules, which can further undergo the citric acid cycle to produce ATP. Palmitic acid is a long-chain fatty acid and contains more carbon atoms than glucose or leucine, which means it has a higher energy content per gram. Therefore, it can yield more ATP than glucose, leucine or alcohol when metabolized.\n\nWhile glucose is a primary source of energy for the body, it is a monosaccharide that undergoes glycolysis to produce ATP. Compared to fatty acid metabolism, glucose oxidation produces fewer ATP per molecule. Similarly, leucine is an amino acid that is primarily used for protein synthesis and is only used as an energy source in certain conditions, such as during prolonged exercise when glycogen stores are depleted. Alcohol is metabolized to acetaldehyde and acetate through a series of reactions in the liver, which can be converted to ATP, but the yield per molecule is lower than that of palmitic acid.\n\nOverall, the correct answer is (B) One gram of palmitic acid. \n\nScores for other agents: \nAgent solution 1: 3 \nAgent solution 2: 2 \nAgent solution 3: 5 \n\n[[3, 2, 5]]", null], ["As a programmer, my area of expertise is not in biochemistry or physiology.

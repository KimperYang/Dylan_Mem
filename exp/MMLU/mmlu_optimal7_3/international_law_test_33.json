[["The difference between conciliation and mediation lies in their procedures and outcomes. Mediation involves the process of a neutral third party facilitating negotiations between two disputing parties to reach an agreement. The mediator has no decision-making authority, and the parties are free to accept or reject the terms of the agreement.\n\nConciliation, on the other hand, involves a commission, which proceeds to an impartial examination of the dispute and proposes settlement terms. The conciliator may propose a solution or make recommendations based on their findings. Unlike mediation, conciliation produces a binding result that the parties must follow.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) - Mediation is usually conducted by a person appointed with the consent of the parties, while conciliation involves a commission, which proceeds to an impartial examination of the dispute and proposes settlement terms.", null, null], ["C) Mediation is usually conducted by a person appointed with the consent of the parties, while conciliation involves a commission, which proceeds to an impartial examination of the dispute and proposes settlement terms.

Women, on the other hand, may be seen as more nurturing and supportive, making them more likely to take on roles in intelligence or humanitarian efforts. \n\nBy recognizing these gendered expectations and questioning them, we can better understand how they impact security and work towards creating a more equitable and effective security apparatus. It is also important to consider how gender intersects with other identities, such as race and sexuality, when analyzing security issues.

[["The security dilemma, as defined by realists, refers to the situation in which an increase in one state's security leads to decreased security for other states.

This concept arises from the idea of realism, which emphasizes the anarchic nature of the international system and the need for self-help by each state. As states strive to ensure their own security, they often engage in actions such as building up their military capabilities, forming alliances, or taking pre-emptive measures that may be perceived as a threat by other states. This can then trigger a cycle of insecurity, as other states respond by also increasing their own military capabilities or taking other measures to protect themselves. \n\nThe impact of security dilemmas is not limited to the military sphere alone but can also have implications for other sectors such as political and societal security.

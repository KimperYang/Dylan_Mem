It involves explaining to the client the treatment strategies that will be used, the expected outcomes of the treatment, and how the reinforcers and rewards will be delivered. Providing information to the client about the treatment gives them a sense of control and understanding of the process, and helps to motivate them to actively participate in the treatment. Therefore, option (A) is a necessary element of an effective contract.\n\nOption (B) is also important because it ensures that the behaviors specified in the contract can be monitored and measured to determine if progress is being made.

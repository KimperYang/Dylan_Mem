Therefore, this option aligns with the drive-reduction theory.\n\nOption B - Ernest eats cookies on the way to class because he didn't have time for lunch. Although he may experience hunger or a need for energy, drive-reduction theory does not provide an adequate explanation as Ernest is not satisfying any physiological need. This goes against the basic premise of the drive-reduction theory, which focuses on fulfilling physiological needs. \n\nOption C - Tish decides to skip lunch despite being full from eating breakfast. This goes against the drive-reduction theory as her physiological need for food has been satisfied, and she is not fulfilling any needs by skipping lunch. Thus, option C would not provide a reasonable explanation according to drive-reduction theory.\n\nOption D - Kezia orders strawberry cheesecake despite being full after dinner. This option does not align with drive-reduction theory as her physiological need for food has already been satisfied, and she isn't reducing any physiological need.

In option A, the behavior is in line with drive-reduction theory as Jerome is fulfilling his physiological need for hydration. In option B, Ernest's behavior could be explained by hunger, but it is not a physiological need that he is trying to satisfy, so drive-reduction theory does not provide a reasonable explanation.

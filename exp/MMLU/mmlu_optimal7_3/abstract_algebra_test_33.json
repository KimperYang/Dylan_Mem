[["Statement 1 is true. This is a basic result in ring theory that states that if an ideal is maximal, then it is also prime. One can prove this by contradiction. Suppose that I is a maximal ideal that is not prime. Then there exist elements a and b such that ab is in I, but neither a nor b is in I. Consider the ideals J = I + (a) and K = I + (b). Since I is not prime, neither J nor K is equal to R. Therefore, both J and K are contained in some maximal ideal M. Since M is maximal, either J or K must be equal to M. Suppose, without loss of generality, that J = M. Then b is not in M, so b + I is a nonzero element of the field R/I. However, (a + I)(b + I) = ab + I is in I + I = I, so (a + I)(b + I) = I. This implies that either a + I = I or b + I = I in R/I. This contradicts the fact that neither a nor b is in I. Therefore, I must be prime.\n\nStatement 2 is also true. This is a consequence of the correspondence theorem for ideals. Let I be a maximal ideal of the commutative ring R. Then there is a one-to-one correspondence between the ideals of R/I and the ideals of R that contain I. Since I is maximal, the only ideals of R that contain I are I itself and R.

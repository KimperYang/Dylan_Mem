[["Statement 1 is true because boosting is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak learners (i.e., classifiers that perform only slightly better than random guessing) to form a stronger classifier. The weak learners are usually of the same functional form (e.g., decision trees), and boosting adjusts their parameters iteratively such that the misclassified samples from the previous iteration receive larger weights in the current iteration. The final classifier f combines all the weak learners using a weighted majority vote, and its decision boundary has the same functional form as the weak learners, but with different weights.

In the case of boosting, cross-validation can be used to select the number of iterations (i.e., rounds of weak learner training) such that the model achieves the best trade-off between bias and variance. If the number of iterations is too low, the model may underfit the data; if it is too high, the model may overfit the data. By using cross-validation to select the optimal number of iterations, we can help reduce the risk of overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) True, False.", "Statement 1 is true since boosting is a technique that combines weak learners to form a strong learner and adjusts their parameters to reduce the bias.

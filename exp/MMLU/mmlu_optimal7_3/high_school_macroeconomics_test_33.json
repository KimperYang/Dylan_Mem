The theory focuses on the role of aggregate demand in determining economic activity. \n\nRegarding investment demand curve, Keynesian economists generally believe that it is relatively inelastic in the short run due to business uncertainties.

Therefore, option D is not the correct answer. \n\nOverall, based on Keynesian economic theory, fiscal policy is more effective than monetary policy as a tool for stabilizing the economy.

[["If the standard of living increases, we can conclude that output must have increased. A higher standard of living usually means that people are able to afford better goods and services which means that businesses must produce more to satisfy the demand. Moreover, a higher standard of living often leads to increased investments and innovations which result in an increase in output. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

An increase in the standard of living refers to an improvement in the quality of life of the people, which can be achieved by an increase in the production and availability of goods and services. When the output of goods and services increases, people have a greater access to them, resulting in an improvement in their living standards.

Therefore, from a psychological perspective, people who cannot reach orgasm without touching a woman's shoe may be considered sexually abnormal or deviant.

Therefore, from a sociological perspective, it may depend on the cultural context whether someone is considered sexually abnormal or deviant for having a shoe fetish.

In this case, the meterstick on one spaceship appears to be 60 cm long to an occupant of the other spaceship, so the proper length of the meterstick is L\u2080=60/\u03b3.\n\nSince both spaceships approach Earth with equal speeds as measured by an observer on Earth, they have equal magnitudes of velocity. Let this velocity be v. Then, using the time dilation formula, the time elapsed on each spaceship is related to the time elapsed on Earth by the equation t=t\u2080/\u03b3, where t\u2080 is the proper time (time elapsed on Earth). \n\nNow let's use the fact that the two metersticks have the same length as measured by the observer on Earth.

Therefore, the above equation must give the same result regardless of which spaceship we use to measure the length. Let's suppose we use the spaceship whose meterstick appears to be 60 cm long to an occupant of the other spaceship.

This gives us a constraint on d:\n\nd < \u221a(3600/3) = 34.64\n\nThis makes sense because if the spaceships are any closer together than this, they will appear to overlap to the observer on Earth.\n\nNow we can solve for v using the equation v=d/t, where t is the time elapsed on Earth. From t=t\u2080/\u03b3, we get:\n\nt\u2080 = t*\u03b3 = \u221a[d\u00b2 + 3600/\u03b3\u00b2]/(60/c)\n\nSubstituting into v=d/t and simplifying, we get:\n\nv = c*(2d/\u221a[d\u00b2 + 3600/\u03b3\u00b2] - 1)/(1 - 2d\u00b2/\u221a[d\u00b2 + 3600/\u03b3\u00b2])\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the speed of the spaceships for different values of d. However, since this is a single-choice question, we can simply check which answer choice is closest to the correct speed for a reasonable value of d. Let's choose d=30, which puts the spaceships at a distance of about 51.96 light-seconds from Earth (recall that the distance light travels in one second is one light-second). \n\nUsing the formula above, we get:\n\nv \u2248 0.555c\n\nThis is closest to choice (B), so the answer is (B).", "The correct answer is (B) 0.5c.\n\nFirst, let's determine the Lorentz factor, \u03b3, using the fact that the meterstick on one spaceship, which we will label as spaceship A, appears to be 60 cm long to an occupant of the other spaceship, which we will label as spaceship B.

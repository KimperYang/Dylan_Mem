There is therefore a strong connection between environmental degradation and violence; resources as strategic goals and strategic tools may cause violence if there is inequity.\n\nThroughout history, conflicts have arisen from access to scarce resources such as land, water, and minerals. As the global population continues to grow, the demand for resources increases and competition for these resources becomes more intense. Strong states have recognized this link between environmental degradation and conflict, and it has become a central concern of their environmental security agendas.\n\nIn many cases, environmental change can lead to resource scarcity, such as droughts limiting water availability or soil erosion affecting agricultural productivity. When resources become scarce, states may resort to using force to secure access to them. This can lead to interstate conflicts, as seen in disputes over water resources in the Middle East, or intrastate conflicts, as seen in the conflicts in Darfur over access to arable land.\n\nInequitable distribution of resources can also lead to violence, where resource-rich areas may be exploited by those in power or by multinational corporations without fair compensation to the local communities.

The security dilemma has implications not just for military security, but for political and societal security as well, as tensions and mistrust can spill over into other areas.

The security dilemma is a concept within international relations that identifies how the actions of one state to increase their own security can be perceived as threatening by other states.

[["As an economist, I want to preface that this question is outside my area of expertise. However, to the best of my knowledge from my exposure to postcolonialism literature and understanding, the most appropriate answer would be (C) The subaltern refers to populations that are marginalised or outside of the hegemonic power structure. The term subaltern was first used in a military context to refer to those of inferior rank. In the postcolonial context, it refers to the socially and economically marginalised groups that exist outside of the dominant power structure.

[["The statement that DOES NOT characterize arms control as a strategic policy is option (D) - After its successful application during the Cold War, arms control has retained its momentum and applicability in the contemporary security environment. While arms control was pursued during the Cold War in an attempt to achieve security, its applicability in the contemporary security environment has been limited. The post-Cold War era has seen an increase in the number of non-state actors acquiring weapons, which has made it difficult to control the proliferation of weapons and regulate their use. Furthermore, the rise of new powers has complicated the traditional security landscape, and the continued development of military technology has rendered existing arms control agreements obsolete. Therefore, arms control has lost much of its momentum in today's security environment.

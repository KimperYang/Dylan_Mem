The string connecting the two books exerts an equal and opposite force on the physics book, causing it to move horizontally across the table surface. Since there is no friction acting on the physics book, the only force acting on it in the horizontal direction is the tension force. Therefore, the acceleration of the physics book is given by the equation F = ma, where F is the force acting on the book, m is the mass of the book, and a is its acceleration. In this case, F is the tension force. As we know the tension force is equal to the weight of the falling book (mg) and there are no other external forces acting on the system, we can set these equal, and solve for the acceleration of the system.

This scenario is an example of the Atwood machine, which consists of two masses connected by a string over a pulley.

The force causing the acceleration of the falling book is the tension in the string, which is less than the weight of the book. Therefore, the acceleration of the falling book is less than g. At the same time, the tension force causes the other book to accelerate horizontally.

When the math book is pushed off the edge of the table, it will experience a gravitational force pulling it down with an acceleration of g. The physics book will be pulled horizontally by the string with a force equal to the tension in the string. The horizontal force could differ from zero to the maximum tension in the string depending on the coefficient of friction between the table and the book, but it can't be greater than the weight of the math book. When the string is taut, the tension force is distributed among the two books.

Therefore, there is now a net force acting on the system in a horizontal direction. Since there is no friction acting on the book that is being dragged, the net force acting on the system is equal to the mass of the system times its horizontal acceleration (F_net = ma_horizontal). \n\nHowever, since the force of gravity is still acting on both books, there is a vertical acceleration as well.

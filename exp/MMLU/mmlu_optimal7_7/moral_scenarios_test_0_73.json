While some states in the US do allow the sale of alcohol without a license, it is generally frowned upon to sell alcohol to strangers in an unregulated environment. Additionally, selling beer for one dollar could indicate that the main character is trying to get rid of the beer quickly, which could be a sign that the beer is low quality or expired. Therefore, this action can be seen as morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 2 involves the main character falsely attributing a joke to Coach Smith.

Moreover, selling beer for one dollar suggests that the character may have a motive other than profit, like discarding low-quality beer that could be harmful for consumption. Because of these potential harms and ethical concerns associated with alcohol sales, this action can be seen as clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character falsely attributes a joke to Coach Smith, which violates the principle of honesty.

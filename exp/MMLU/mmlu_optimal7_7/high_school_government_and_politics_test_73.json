The presidential elections of 1932 and 1968, as well as the midterm election of 1994, all had major shifts in party alignment that lasted for decades. In 1932, Franklin Roosevelt and the Democratic Party successfully mobilized the support of African Americans, blue-collar workers, urbanites, and other previously marginalized groups. This marked a significant shift away from the Republican Party's traditional base of support. Similarly, in 1968, Richard Nixon's \"Southern Strategy\" successfully appealed to white Southerners who had previously supported the Democratic Party, marking the realignment of the South as a Republican stronghold. The midterm election of 1994 saw the Republican Party gain control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years, largely due to the success of Newt Gingrich's Contract with America.

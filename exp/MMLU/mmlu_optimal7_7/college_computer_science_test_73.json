So, this option may deal effectively with the problem of deadlock. \n\nB) Having a process request all its required resources when it first begins, and restarting if it cannot obtain them all: While this approach can prevent deadlocks from occurring in the first place, it doesn't deal with situations where deadlocks might have already occurred.

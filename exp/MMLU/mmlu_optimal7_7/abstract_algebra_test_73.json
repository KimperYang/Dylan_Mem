So, I cannot give them a score.\n\nBased on the explanations of agents 1, 2, 5, and 6, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q is either 2 or 4. After careful consideration, I believe that the degree is 4 since both sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are contained in the field extension and so is their sum and product.\n\nTherefore, my updated answer is (B) 4, and my scores for the agent's responses are [[5, 5, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]].", null], ["As a programmer, I don't have much expertise in field theory, but based on my knowledge in math, I can attempt to solve the problem. \n\nWe notice that Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) is obtained by adjoining the elements sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) to the field Q of rational numbers. \n\nNow, the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q is x^2 - 2, and the minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q is x^2 - 3. The degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2)) over Q is therefore 2, and the degree of Q(sqrt(3)) over Q is also 2. \n\nNow, since sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) is a root of the polynomial (x - sqrt(2) - sqrt(3))^2 = x^2 - 2sqrt(2)x - 2sqrt(3)x + 5 - 2sqrt(6), we know that its degree over Q is less than or equal to 2. \n\nTo see that the degree is exactly 2, we just need to check that 1 and sqrt(2) are linearly independent over Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)). Indeed, if there were rational numbers a and b such that a + b(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) = 0, then we could rearrange to get b = -(a/(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))), and plugging in we would obtain a equation in sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) that is satisfied by the rational number a, which means that a = 0. Therefore, b = 0 as well, and the extension is indeed of degree 2. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 2.", null, null], ["As a historian, my area of expertise lies in analyzing cultural, economic, political and social events of the past.

The degree of the field extension is the dimension of the field over the base field Q, which is the rational numbers.\n\nHere is my solution:\n\nWe observe that Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) is obtained by adjoining the elements sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) to the field Q of rational numbers. \n\nTo find the degree of the field extension, we need to determine the dimension of the field extension as a vector space over Q. One way to do this is to find a basis for the field extension. \n\nIt can be shown that {1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(6)} is a basis for the field extension. This is because any element of Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) can be written as a linear combination of 1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), and sqrt(6) with rational coefficients, and these elements are linearly independent over Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)).\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the field extension is 4, which corresponds to choice (B).

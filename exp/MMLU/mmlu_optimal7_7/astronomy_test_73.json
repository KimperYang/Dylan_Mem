This is because the distance from the sun alone does not determine the severity of seasons. For instance, Pluto is farther from the sun than Neptune, but Neptune has far more extreme seasonal variations because of its axial tilt.\n\nOption (B), because Mars has more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than the Earth, may be a contributing factor, but it alone is unlikely to be the sole reason for the extreme Martian seasons.\n\nOption (C), because Mars has a more eccentric orbit than the Earth, may also contribute to the severity of Martian seasons, but it alone is unlikely to be the sole reason for this phenomenon.\n\nThus, option (D), because Mars' axis is more tilted than the Earth's is the most likely answer. Earth has a tilt of about 23.5 degrees whereas Mars has a tilt of around 25 degrees. This difference causes more extreme seasonal changes in Mars' southern hemisphere compared to the Earth. \n\nTherefore, my answer is (D).", null, null], ["As a historian, my area of expertise is not in planetary science, and I recognize that it is important to defer to experts in the field for accurate answers to such questions.

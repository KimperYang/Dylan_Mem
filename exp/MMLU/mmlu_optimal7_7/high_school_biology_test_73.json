Over time, certain traits become more or less common in a population, leading to evolutionary changes. The gene pool in a population is not fixed, and genetic changes can occur through mechanisms such as mutation, gene flow and genetic drift. Therefore, the option that best explains why a population is described as the evolutionary unit is D) Individuals cannot evolve, but populations can. (D)", null, null]]
[["Based on the given scenario, the most likely correct statement is (C) Selection favors some phenotypes over others. This is because the dark-colored mice are better camouflaged in the lava formations, while the light-colored mice are better camouflaged in the sandy desert.

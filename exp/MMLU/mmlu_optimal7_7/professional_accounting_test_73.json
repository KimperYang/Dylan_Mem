[["When a company declares a stock dividend, the par value of the stock is transferred from retained earnings to the common stock account and the market value of the dividend is transferred from retained earnings to additional paid-in capital.

This consists of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Direct materials cost is given as $114,000, and direct labor cost is given as $38,000. Manufacturing overhead is assigned at the rate of 50% of direct materials, so it amounts to $57,000 (0.5 x $114,000).

This includes completed units and the ending work-in-process inventory. From the given information, 10,000 units were started, and 9,000 completed units were transferred. Therefore, the number of units in the ending work-in-process inventory is 10,000 - 9,000 = 1,000. The ending work-in-process inventory is 50% complete as to conversion. Thus, the equivalent whole units for the ending work-in-process inventory is 1,000 x 0.50 = 500.

[["(A) In periods of rising prices, the LIFO method results in a lower cost of sales and higher taxable income, when compared to the FIFO method. This is because the LIFO method assumes that the most recent inventory items are sold first, which means that the cost of goods sold reflects the higher prices of those recently acquired items.

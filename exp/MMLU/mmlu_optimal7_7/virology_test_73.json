The spread of filoviruses, such as Ebola and Marburg, can be restricted through multiple measures. While new antivirals and humanized monoclonal antibodies can help treat those who are infected, they do not necessarily prevent the spread of the disease. \n\nThe most effective way to restrict the spread of filoviruses is through hygiene and social distancing practices. This includes regular hand washing, avoiding close contact with infected individuals, wearing personal protective equipment if in close contact, and isolating infected individuals to prevent further spread. \n\nAnother important way to restrict the spread of filoviruses is through vaccination. New vaccines can help protect individuals from contracting the disease and can prevent the spread of the virus from infected individuals to those who are not yet infected.

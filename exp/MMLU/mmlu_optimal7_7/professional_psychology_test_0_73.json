This refers to the system's ability to restore its status quo when it has been disrupted. For example, if a family experiences a major change, such as a divorce or the arrival of a new baby, the system will work to restore balance and stability.\n\nFinally, positive feedback is the property of a family system that disrupts homeostasis by creating deviations in the status quo.

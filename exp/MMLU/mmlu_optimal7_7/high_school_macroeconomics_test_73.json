As such, I find it to be in line with my understanding of Keynesian economics, and I give it a score of 5.\n\nAgent solution 6 provides a neutral explanation of each choice and emphasizes that the accuracy of each statement relies on many interconnected factors. While the solution does not take a stance on the correctness of any particular option, it provides helpful context on these issues, and therefore I give it a score of 4.\n\nAgent solution 7 acknowledges that Keynesians argue for the direct effect of fiscal policy on demand and propose that fluctuations can only be remedied by government intervention. The solution talks about how this is usually through fiscal policy; nevertheless, it acknowledges that monetary policy can also influence demand. Therefore, considering the limits implied by the other agents, I give it a score of 5.\n\nMy Answer: Given my knowledge of Keynesian economics, I think that the answer that best aligns with Keynesian principles is B) fiscal policy is more effective than monetary policy. Keynesians believe that during the time of a recession or depression, the government must increase spending and decrease taxation to boost demand. \n\nScores: [[5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5]].", null]]

However, at the same time, the increased demand can incentivize firms to increase their prices somewhat, which is why we see both effects.\n\nIn summary, the answer is (D) because an increase in aggregate demand can lead to both higher prices and increased real GDP in the intermediate range of the aggregate supply curve.", null, null], ["As a psychologist, sociology, and philosophy expert, my expertise doesn't lie in economics.

[["As an economist, I am not an expert in the field of energy consumption or waste.

According to my medical expertise, generally, Americans consume approximately one drink with two ice cubes per day. It could be assumed that half of an average cup of 16 ounces gets filled with ice. If we assume the density of water to be 1 g/cm^3, then the two ice cubes in one drink will weigh approximately 30 grams. Therefore, Americans use approximately 30 grams of ice per day per capita.\n\nAssuming that the population of the United States is approximately 328 million and each one of them wastes 30 grams of ice per day, then, in total, about 10 billion grams of ice are wasted each day in drinks.

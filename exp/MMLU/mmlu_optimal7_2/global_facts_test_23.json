However, it's important to note that the level of growth varied greatly among these countries and regions. \n\nChoice (A) can be eliminated as it seems unlikely that the growth rate of average incomes in less developed countries was zero for such a long period of time, especially with the implementation of policies aimed at economic growth. \n\nChoice (B) may be a possibility, but it's not entirely accurate to say that the growth rate of less developed countries was consistently higher than that of high-income countries. There were certainly cases where less developed countries had a higher growth rate, but there were also instances where their growth rate was lower than that of high-income countries. \n\nChoice (C) can also be eliminated as it's highly unlikely that the growth rate of less developed countries surpassed that of Britain during the Industrial Revolution, which was a period of unprecedented economic expansion. \n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is (D), which states that the growth rate of average incomes in less developed countries during the stated period was approximately 3.0% per year.

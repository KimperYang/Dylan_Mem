[["The most valid method for producing a 10-day forecast of volatility would be to produce 1-step ahead conditional variance forecast and take its square root, then multiply by the square root of 10 (choice D).

Adding or summing up the conditional variance forecasts for 10 days could cause the forecast to be biased and overestimate the long-term volatility. Taking the square root of each forecast and then adding them up (choice C) would lead to a similar outcome. Conversely, adding the 1, 2, 3,..., 10 step ahead conditional variance forecasts (choice A) and adding their square roots before taking the square root could underestimate the long-term volatility and result in a forecast that is too low.

[["Option (D) is the correct answer. The argument made by Braun and Chyba (2004) suggests that indigenous nuclear programs are making proliferation safeguards obsolete. This means that the effort to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons may be undermined by the development of nuclear programs by states that previously did not possess such capabilities. In order to support this argument, it can be argued that possessing weapons of mass destruction (WMD) can provide the means to offset inferiority in conventional armaments compared to regional or superpower rivals. Possessing WMD can act as a deterrence to stronger opponents against potential threats, or be used to defeat adversaries if engaged in combat.\n\nFurthermore, whilst nuclear capabilities may be elusive, international or domestic terrorist networks may have the resources to construct and use chemical, biological, and radiological weapons. This suggests that the proliferation of WMD poses a significant threat to global security and peace. Additionally, the potential threats posed by each type of weapon are different, which means that WMD vary vastly in terms of their availability, lethality, and destructive potential and the ease with which they can be manufactured.

Asp235Phe refers to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) where asparagine (Asp) at position 235 in the amino acid sequence has been replaced by phenylalanine (Phe). The abbreviation \"Asp\" for asparagine and \"Phe\" for phenylalanine in the notation indicate that asparagine has been replaced by phenylalanine. \n\n[[5, 4]]", "The correct answer is (C) aspartic acid has been replaced by phenylalanine. Asp is the abbreviation of aspartic acid and Phe refers to phenylalanine. Asparagine is abbreviated as Asn. Therefore, (A) and (B) can be immediately eliminated. To determine the correct answer between (C) and (D), we need to look at the difference between aspartic acid and phenylalanine. Aspartic acid is an acidic amino acid, while phenylalanine is an aromatic amino acid. The side chain of aspartic acid has a -COOH group while the side chain of phenylalanine has an aromatic ring. Asp235Phe indicates that the aspartic acid at position 235 in the amino acid sequence has been replaced by phenylalanine, leading to the loss of an acidic group in the side chain. Thus, aspartic acid has been replaced by phenylalanine, which gives us answer (C). \n\n[[3, 5]]"], ["The answer is (A) asparagine has been replaced by phenylalanine. The abbreviation \"Asp\" in Asp235Phe represents aspartic acid, which has been replaced by phenylalanine indicated by \"Phe\". Therefore, we can conclude that asparagine has replaced aspartic acid, and the answer is (A).", "The correct answer is (C) aspartic acid has been replaced by phenylalanine. \"Asp\" indicates aspartic acid, and \"Phe\" indicates phenylalanine. According to the single-letter amino acid code, \"N\" represents asparagine while \"D\" represents aspartic acid. Therefore, (A) and (B) can be immediately eliminated. To determine the correct answer between (C) and (D), we need to look at the difference between aspartic acid and phenylalanine. Aspartic acid is an acidic amino acid, while phenylalanine is an aromatic amino acid. Since aspartic acid contains a carboxyl group (-COOH) while phenylalanine doesn't, the substitution causes the loss of an acidic group. Thus, aspartic acid has been replaced by phenylalanine, which gives us answer (C). \n\n[[3, 4]]", "The correct answer is (C) aspartic acid has been replaced by phenylalanine. The abbreviation Asp235Phe means that the amino acid aspartic acid (Asp) at position 235 has been replaced by phenylalanine (Phe). Choice (A) can be eliminated because \"Asp\" does not refer to asparagine, and choice (B) can be eliminated because \"Phe\" does not refer to asparagine. To decide between choices (C) and (D), we need to understand the properties of aspartic acid and phenylalanine. Aspartic acid is an acidic amino acid that contains a carboxyl group (-COOH), while phenylalanine is an aromatic amino acid that does not contain a carboxyl group. When aspartic acid is replaced with phenylalanine, the result is the loss of an acidic group. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) aspartic acid has been replaced by phenylalanine. \n\nSolution 1: Score 5. The explanation is clear and well-reasoned. \nSolution 2: Score 2. The answer is incorrect because it refers to a SNP, which is not relevant to the question."]]
[["The mutational mechanism in \u03b4\u03b2-thalassemia involves a point mutation.

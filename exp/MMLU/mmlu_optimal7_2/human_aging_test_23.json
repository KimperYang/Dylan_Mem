[["Neuroticism is a personality trait characterized by emotional instability, anxiety, moodiness, and a proneness to experience negative emotions. Recent research suggests that an increase in neuroticism later in life is a strong predictor of cognitive decline. People who score higher on measures of neuroticism have been found to be at an increased risk for developing cognitive impairment and dementia, possibly due to the negative impact of chronic stress on the brain. In contrast, there is no evidence to suggest that an increase in neuroticism later in life affects mortality, loss of social support, or independence. Therefore, the answer to the question is (C) cognitive decline.", null, null], ["Studies have shown that an increase in neuroticism later in life is a strong predictor of cognitive decline. Neuroticism is a trait that reflects a tendency towards experiencing negative emotions such as anxiety and fear. As individuals age, an increase in neuroticism can lead to a decline in cognitive function, including memory, attention, and problem-solving ability. This decline in cognitive function can then lead to a decrease in independence and an increased risk of mortality. Therefore, the answer is (C).", null, null]]

The correct answer is (C).", "The correct answer is (C) Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the distributor and the wholesaler. \n\nExplanation: Diversity of citizenship jurisdiction requires complete diversity, meaning that no plaintiff can be from the same state as any defendant.

[["The answer to the question \"When the true cost of an item is deliberately obscured by a company this is known as?\" is (B) Deceptive pricing. Deceptive pricing occurs when a company intentionally misrepresents the price of a product or service in order to deceive consumers. This can take many forms, such as hidden fees, false sales, or unclear pricing structures. Deceptive pricing is illegal and unethical because it prevents consumers from being able to make informed purchasing decisions. Therefore, (B) is the correct answer.", null, null], ["The act of deliberately obscuring the true cost of an item by a company is known as deceptive pricing.

Additionally, they create artificial needs, in which consumers may feel pressure to purchase products they do not truly need or want. Marketing communications also reinforce consumerism, perpetuating the idea that material possessions are necessary for happiness and success.

[["The correct answer is (D) The Portuguese knew of a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope in the south of Africa. The Treaty of Tordesillas was a result of the competition between the Spanish and Portuguese to expand their empires and control the resources of the New World.

This route, known as the Cape Route, would be east of the demarcation line established by the Treaty of Tordesillas, giving Portugal control of these lands.

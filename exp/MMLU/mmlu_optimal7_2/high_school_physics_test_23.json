Therefore, the acceleration of the proton can be calculated as a = F/m.\n\nSince the proton's initial velocity vector makes an angle of 30\u00b0 with the direction of B, the velocity component perpendicular to B can be found using the equation, v\u22a5 = vsin(\u03b8).

[["The answer is (B) 6 m/s. The flow rate of the liquid must remain constant throughout the pipe, so we can use the equation Q = A1V1 = A2V2, where Q is the flow rate, A is the cross-sectional area, and V is the flow speed.

That is, if r does not divide m or s does not divide n, then Z_r + Z_s is not isomorphic to Z_m + Z_n. \n\nLet's assume, without loss of generality, that r does not divide m. Then we can write m = qr + t, for some integers q and t with 0 < t < r. Then Z_m is isomorphic to Z_{qr} + Z_t. Similarly, we can write n = us + v, for some integers u and v with 0 < v < s, and Z_n is isomorphic to Z_{us} + Z_v. \n\nNow, consider the direct sum of Z_r and Z_s. Its order is rs and it contains at least one cyclic subgroup of order r (generated by (1,0)) and one cyclic subgroup of order s (generated by (0,1)). Suppose Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to Z_m + Z_n. Then there must exist a pair of generators (a,b) for Z_r + Z_s and (c,d) for Z_m + Z_n such that the isomorphism maps (a,b) to (c,d). Since (a,b) has order rs, we must have (c,d) also has order rs. Therefore, the orders of c and d are coprime to each other. \n\nNow, we can write (c,d) as k(q,r) + l(u,s) + (p,t) + (q,r) + (u,s) + (v,s) for some integers k, l, and p. Since the orders of c and d are coprime to each other, we must have k + q + l + u = 0 and p + t + v = 0. \n\nTherefore, we can write (c,d) as (k-q, l-u) + k(1,0) + l(0,1) + (p,t) + (q,r) + (u,s) + (v,s). Since (k-q, l-u) has order coprime to r and s, it must be mapped to (0,0) under the isomorphism. Therefore, we have reduced the problem to showing that Z_r + Z_s is not isomorphic to Z_{qr} + Z_t + Z_{us} + Z_v + Z_{rs}. \n\nAssume the contrary, and let (a,b) and (c,d) be generators for the two groups, respectively. Then we can write (a,b) as (x,y) + sa + rb for some integers x, y, s, and r, with 0 < x < r and 0 < y < s. Similarly, we can write (c,d) as ta + ub + vc + vd + we, for some integers t, u, v, w, and e. Moreover, we can choose t and u such that 0 < t < q and 0 < u < u. We can also choose w such that 0 \u2264 w < r and (v+w)s = v (mod s). \n\nNow, we compute the order of (a,b) + (c,d). Note that (a,b) + (c,d) = (x+ta+wu+vc, y+ub+vd) + rb + sa + we. The order of (a,b) + (c,d) divides rs, since it lies in Z_r + Z_s.

[["Statement 1 is true, and it is a well-known fact in commutative algebra that every maximal ideal is a prime ideal. This is one of the fundamental results in the theory of ideals, and it has many important consequences. One way to see this result is to observe that if I is a maximal ideal, then R/I is a field, so every non-zero element of R/I has an inverse. But if I is not a prime ideal, then there exist elements a, b not in I such that ab is in I. This implies that the images of a and b in R/I multiply to zero, which contradicts the fact that R/I is a field.\n\nStatement 2 is also true, and it is a consequence of the fact that every maximal ideal is a prime ideal. Suppose that I is a maximal ideal of R. We want to show that R/I is a field, so let's prove the two axioms required for a field. First, every non-zero element of R/I has an inverse. Suppose that a is a non-zero element of R/I, so a is the image of some element x in R such that x is not in I. Then, since I is maximal, the ideal generated by I and x is all of R, so there exist elements r, s in R such that r belongs to I and s belongs to the ideal generated by I and x such that 1 = r + sx. Therefore, the image of s is an inverse of the image of a in R/I. Second, R/I is commutative and has a multiplicative identity, so all we need to check is that addition and multiplication are well-defined on R/I. But this is straightforward: if x, y are elements of R such that x - y belongs to I, and if a, b are elements of R such that a - x, b - y belongs to I, then (a + b) - (x + y) belongs to I.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A).", null, null], ["Statement 1: Every maximal ideal is a prime ideal. This statement is true. Let M be a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R. We want to show that M is a prime ideal, that is, whenever xy \u2208 M, then either x \u2208 M or y \u2208 M.\n\nSuppose xy \u2208 M. Consider the factor ring R/M. Then the images of x and y in this factor ring satisfy (x + M)(y + M) = xy + M = 0 + M. Since R/M is a field, either x + M = 0 + M or y + M = 0 + M. This means that either x \u2208 M or y \u2208 M, proving that M is a prime ideal.\n\nStatement 2: If I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R, then R/I is a field. This statement is also true. Let I be a maximal ideal of R, and consider the factor ring R/I. We must show that every nonzero element of this ring has a multiplicative inverse.\n\nTake any element x + I in R/I such that x + I \u2260 0 + I. Then x \u2209 I, so the ideal generated by x and I is R. Hence, there exist elements a, b \u2208 R such that ax + bi = 1. This implies that (a + I)(x + I) = 1 + I, so x + I has a multiplicative inverse in R/I.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) True, True.", null, null]]

We can begin by noticing that roots of the polynomial (x\u00b2 - 5) are (\u221a2 + \u221a3) and (\u221a2 - \u221a3). Hence, the field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q is contained in the field extension Q(sqrt(6)) over Q because we can express both of these roots in terms of sqrt(6). Additionally, we observe that (\u221a6 - (\u221a2 + \u221a3)) is in Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)), and therefore, Q(sqrt(6)) over Q is contained in Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q.

[["The construction of freeways generally leads to urban sprawl, traffic increase, and traffic congestion. Urban sprawl refers to the expansion of urban areas towards rural areas, resulting in the loss of open space and natural habitats. Freeways often lead to the development of new suburbs and commercial areas along their routes, contributing to urban sprawl. Traffic increase is a natural consequence of the construction of freeways, since they provide a faster and more efficient transportation option than surface streets. This, in turn, leads to traffic congestion on the freeway and surrounding surface streets. However, the construction of freeways does not lead to decreased dependency on cars, as they often encourage more car usage rather than providing an alternative mode of transportation.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (D) Decreased dependency on cars.", null, null], ["The construction of freeways can lead to many effects on the surrounding environment. However, one of the effects is not decreased dependency on cars.

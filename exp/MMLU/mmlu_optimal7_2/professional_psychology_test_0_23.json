This can lead to a change in beliefs or attitudes to reduce the discomfort and achieve cognitive consistency. In forced compliance situations, an individual may feel compelled to behave in a way that is not consistent with their beliefs or attitudes. If there is a large reward for this behavior, such as a significant monetary incentive, the individual may be more likely to reduce the discomfort of cognitive dissonance by rationalizing their behavior and changing their beliefs or attitudes to be consistent with their behavior.

Hence, they might feel cognitive dissonance, and try to reduce it by changing their beliefs.\n\nWhen compliance is accompanied by a large reward, like a significant financial incentive, individuals are more likely to justify their behavior, reducing the tension of cognitive dissonance. In contrast, compliance with small rewards or no reward at all is less likely to change attitudes. Extreme polarization is more likely to strengthen pre-existing attitudes than alter them.

They may need varying levels of support in all domains of daily living and require structured learning and routine. They may acquire basic academic skills like functional reading and writing and numeracy, and in some cases, they can acquire up to an eighth-grade level. They may be capable of performing some unskilled work under close supervision, but it is not the only expectation for their abilities. However, they do have significant limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior and minimal or no impairment in sensorimotor functioning. \n\nTherefore, based on the description above, answer (A) is incorrect.

[["The quantum efficiency of a photon detector is 0.1, which means that for every 10 photons sent into the detector, only 1 will be detected. Therefore, if 100 photons are sent into the detector one after the other, we can expect that about 10 photons will be detected on average (i.e. we expect to have 10 detections). This leads us to eliminate options A and D.\n\nNow we need to look at the possible range of deviation of the number of detections from the average value. Since the probability of detecting a photon is 0.1 for each photon, this is a binomial distribution problem. For a binomial distribution, the standard deviation is equal to the square root of the product of the number of trials, the probability of success, and the probability of failure. In this case, the number of trials is 100, the probability of success is 0.1, and the probability of failure (not detecting a photon) is 0.9.\n\nSo, the standard deviation of the distribution is the square root of (100 x 0.1 x 0.9) = 3. Therefore, the expected range of deviation from the average value is about 3. This leads us to choose option (C) as the best answer, which states that the detector will detect an average of 10 photons with an rms deviation of about 1.", null, null], ["The quantum efficiency of a photon detector is the ratio of the number of detected photons to the number of incident photons.

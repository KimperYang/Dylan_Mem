[["The answer to the question is (D) all of the above. Purely mechanical instruments such as spring scales, pendulum timers, and mechanical pressure gauges have inherent limitations that make them unsuitable for measuring dynamic parameters. They suffer from high levels of inertia, which means they resist changes in motion and require more force to start and stop. They also have significant response times, making them unsuitable for accurately measuring fast or rapidly changing events. Finally, their large time constant results in a slow response to changes in the measured parameter, reducing their overall accuracy and precision. Therefore, purely mechanical instruments cannot be used for dynamic measurements due to a combination of these factors.", null, null], ["Purely mechanical instruments cannot be used for dynamic measurements because they have all of the above qualities. First, high inertia refers to a resistance of a physical object to change its state of motion. In the case of a purely mechanical instrument, its mechanical components, such as gears, levers, or springs, have mass and require force to accelerate and decelerate, resulting in a slow response time to changes in the measured variable. Secondly, higher response time means that the instrument requires more time to settle down to a steady-state after a change in the measured variable. In other words, the instrument may oscillate before measuring the final value. Finally, a large time constant means that it takes more time for the instrument to reach its final value. Therefore, purely mechanical instruments are not suitable for dynamic measurements because they have higher inertia, higher response time, and large time constant. The answer is (D).", null, null]]

[["The question is related to the deflection method direct measurements. Deflection methods are used to measure unknown quantities, such as the voltage, current, or resistance.

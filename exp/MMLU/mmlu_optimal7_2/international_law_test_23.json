[["The most accurate answer to this question is (A) When the coastal State cannot harvest the 'total allowable catch', the coastal State is to give other State access to that surplus with priority to be given to developing and land-locked States. This is based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which states that coastal States have exclusive rights to the fisheries within their EEZ, but should allow other States access to the surplus if they are unable to harvest it themselves. This access should be given with priority to developing and land-locked States, as specified in UNCLOS.

This is in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which recognizes the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) as an area where the coastal State has special rights regarding the exploration, exploitation, conservation, and management of natural resources, including fisheries. However, if the coastal State is unable to harvest the entire allowable catch, it should provide access to other States with priority given to developing and land-locked States. This is known as the concept of surplus or excess catch. Therefore, third States can enjoy fishing rights in the EEZ of another State, but only in certain circumstances and subject to the rules established by UNCLOS. (A)", null, null]]

[["The difference between conciliation and mediation lies in their processes and outcomes. Mediation is a voluntary process where a neutral third party helps the disputing parties to reach a mutually acceptable solution. The mediator facilitates communication between the parties and helps them to explore different options to settle the dispute. However, the mediator doesn't impose a binding solution on the parties. On the other hand, conciliation involves a commission, usually appointed by a treaty, to impartially examine the dispute and propose settlement terms. Unlike mediation, conciliation can result in a binding solution that the parties have to follow.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D).

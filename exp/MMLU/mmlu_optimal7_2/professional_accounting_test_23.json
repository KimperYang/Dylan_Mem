[["The amount Corbet should report as amortization expense related to the copyright would be $400.

Therefore, it cannot be used to calculate the amortization expense. However, since Corbet expects to sell the book for five years, the maximum amortization expense that can be recognized each year is $400 [($20,000 cost - $0 residual value) / 50 years legal life = $400/year].

We don't know how many shares of stock Lemon received as a dividend, so we'll have to make some assumptions. Assuming the dividend was applied to all 2000 shares of stock and the stock price was the same as the purchase price ($10.50), Lemon would have received 100 shares of stock as a dividend (5% of 2000) worth $1050 (100 x $10.50).\n- In year 5, the stock split 2-for-1. This means that for each share Lemon owned, they received an additional share. So, Lemon now owns 4000 shares of stock with a basis of $21,000.\n- In the current year, Lemon sold 800 shares. We need to determine Lemon's basis in these shares.\n\nTo determine Lemon's basis in the 800 shares sold, we can use the average cost method.

[["The answer is (B) Maintain redundant systems for instant availability to assure the flow of transactions. In an e-commerce environment where the IT system is essential for conducting business, any system downtime can result in a significant loss of revenue. To avoid this, an organization must invest in redundant systems that can take over immediately in the event of a system failure.

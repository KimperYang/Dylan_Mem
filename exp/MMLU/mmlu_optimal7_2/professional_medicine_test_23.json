The question is asking which measurement is most likely to be decreased compared to the measurement before the session. \n\nThe correct answer is (C) systolic blood pressure. During exercise, the heart beats faster and harder to pump more blood to the body's muscles. As a result, systolic blood pressure, which measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats, will increase during exercise. However, after exercise, the body starts to relax and blood pressure typically decreases.

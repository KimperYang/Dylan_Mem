When using C or C++, developers often use low-level memory manipulation functions such as strcpy and strcat, which do not perform checks to ensure that the destination buffer has enough space to hold the source data. As a result, if the source data is larger than expected, it can overwrite adjacent memory, including other variables in the program or even the return address of the function. This can lead to serious security vulnerabilities and crashes.

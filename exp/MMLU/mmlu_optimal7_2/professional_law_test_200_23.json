It is true that the nurse's negligence was a superseding cause of the helper's injury. The nurse administered the wrong medication, which was not foreseeable from the original accident. However, it could be argued that the original accident- the man pushing the helper out of the truck- set off a chain of events that ultimately led to the nurse's negligence. If the man had not pushed the helper out of the truck, he would not have been in the hospital in the first place and would not have been given the wrong medication. Therefore, it could be said that the man's negligence was at least a contributing factor to the helper's sterility.\n\nIn conclusion, the man would be liable for the helper's broken leg, but would not recover damages for his sterility due to the nurse's negligence.

This differentiation based on environment is a result of natural selection and not due to a recent common ancestor or mutations. Therefore, I would choose option C) Selection favors some phenotypes over others. (C)", null, null], ["The correct statement about this scenario is (C) Selection favors some phenotypes over others. This is because the dark-colored mice are better camouflaged on the black lava formations while the light-colored mice blend in better with the sandy desert. Over time, natural selection would favor the mice with better camouflage, leading to the separation of the two populations based on their coloring. This is an example of natural selection driving the adaptation and divergence of species. (C)", null, null]]
[["The evolution of male satin bowerbirds adorning their bowers with ornaments to attract females is due to sexual selection. This is because the behavior is specifically geared towards attracting a mate, as females inspect the bowers and choose males they are interested in mating with based on the quality of the adornments. Sexual selection is a type of natural selection that specifically affects a species' ability to mate, rather than just survive. So, the answer is (C).", null, null], ["The evolution of this male behavior is due to sexual selection. The male satin bowerbirds adorn their bowers with ornaments to attract females, and the females choose a mate based on the quality of the ornaments and the structure of the bower. This type of mate choice is a classic example of sexual selection. (C)", null, null], [null, null, null], ["C) Sexual Selection. \n\nThe behavior of male satin bowerbirds is an example of sexual selection. Sexual selection is a type of natural selection that occurs when individuals of one sex choose mates based on certain traits that they find attractive. In this case, male satin bowerbirds adorn their bowers with attractive ornaments in order to attract females, who then choose mates based on the quality of the bower and the ornaments. This behavior has evolved over time because it confers reproductive advantages to males who are able to attract more females, and therefore have a higher chance of passing on their genes. Therefore, the evolution of this behavior is due to sexual selection (C).", null, null]]

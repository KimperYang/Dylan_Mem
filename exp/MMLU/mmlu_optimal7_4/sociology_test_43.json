[["Yes, I can answer the question. Socialization is the process of becoming part of a society by learning its norms and values. It is through socialization that individuals acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to participate in social life.

Socialization is a crucial aspect of human development as it allows for the formation of personal and social identities.

[["In Herberg's (1955) study of religion in America, he suggested that all of the above options are true.

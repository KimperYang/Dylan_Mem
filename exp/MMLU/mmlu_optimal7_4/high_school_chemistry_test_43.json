The more disorder there is, the higher the entropy. When a chemical reaction occurs, the entropy of the system can either increase or decrease. If the reaction results in an increase in the number of particles or states (such as from a gas to a liquid), then the entropy increases. If the reaction results in a decrease in the number of particles or states (such as from a gas to a solid), then the entropy decreases.\n\nIn the case of the four reactions given, we need to determine which one will result in the greatest decrease in entropy. Reaction (A) involves the combination of two aqueous solutions. While this does result in the formation of a solid and a liquid, the number of particles overall does not decrease significantly, so the entropy change is minimal.\n\nReaction (C) involves the formation of a gas from a solid and a gas.

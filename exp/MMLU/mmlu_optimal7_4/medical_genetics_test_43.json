[["The answer to the question is (C) 0.02. X-linked recessive conditions are conditions that are carried on the X chromosome, and females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. For a female to be affected by an X-linked recessive condition, she must have the condition on both of her X chromosomes. However, for a male to be affected, he must only have the condition on his one X chromosome since he does not have another X chromosome to \"protect\" him. \n\nGiven that the frequency of affected males is 0.10, or one in ten, we know that the proportion of males that are affected is 1/10 or 0.10. Since only males can express the disease phenotype in the hemizygous state, this means that the proportion of X-chromosomes in the population that carry the mutation is also 0.1. \n\nNow, we need to calculate the expected frequency of affected females. We can do this using the Hardy-Weinberg equation, which is a mathematical formula that describes how allele frequencies in a population are related to genotype frequencies. \n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg equation states that p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1, where p is the frequency of one allele and q is the frequency of the other allele. In this case, we are interested in the frequency of the X-linked recessive allele, which we can call \"r\". Let's assume that the frequency of the normal allele is \"R\" (which is equal to 1-r). \n\nWe already know that the frequency of the r allele is 0.1 (since 0.1 of all X-chromosomes in the population carry the mutation). Therefore, we can plug in the values into the Hardy-Weinberg equation for females: \n\n(R + r)2 = R2 + 2Rr + r2 = 1 \n\nWe want to find the frequency of affected females, which is the proportion of females that are homozygous for the r allele. This is represented by r2 in the equation. \n\nWe can solve for r2 by using algebra: \n\nr2 = 1 - R2 - 2Rr \n\nNow, we need to estimate the value of R (the frequency of the normal allele) in the female population. Since females have two X chromosomes, they can be either homozygous for the normal allele (RR), heterozygous (Rr), or homozygous for the recessive allele (rr). Let's assume that the frequency of the recessive rr genotype is negligible, which means that we can assume that the frequency of R in the female population is equal to the square root of the proportion of females who are carriers (heterozygotes) for the r allele. \n\nThe frequency of carriers in the female population is equal to 2pq, where p is the frequency of R and q is the frequency of r. We know that q = 0.1 (from the frequency of affected males), so we can solve for p: \n\n2pq = frequency of carriers \n0.2p = frequency of carriers \np = frequency of carriers / 0.2 \n\nTherefore, we need to find the square root of the frequency of carriers divided by 0.2: \n\nsquare root(frequency of carriers / 0.2) = square root (2pq / 0.2) = square root (10pq) \n\nWe already know that q = 0.1, so we can substitute that in: \n\nsquare root (10p * 0.1) = square root (p) * square root (1) = square root(p) \n\nThus, the frequency of the normal allele in the female population is equal to the square root of p. \n\nWe can now substitute these values into our equation for r2: \n\nr2 = 1 - R2 - 2Rp \nr2 = 1 - (square root(p))^2 - 2(square root(p))(0.1) \n\nSimplifying, we get: \n\nr2 = 0.2p - 0.01 \n\nWe know that the frequency of the r allele is 0.1, so the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (rr) is predicted to be: \n\nr2 = 0.2(0.1) - 0.01 = 0.02 \n\nTherefore, the expected frequency of affected females is 0.02, or 2% of the female population. The answer is (C).", null, null], ["Firstly, it is important to understand the genetics of X-linked recessive conditions. These conditions are caused by a mutation on the X chromosome, which means that males, who only inherit one X chromosome, are more likely to be affected. Females, who inherit two X chromosomes, must inherit two copies of the mutated gene to be affected. Therefore, the frequency of affected males should be higher than the frequency of affected females.\n\nGiven that the frequency of affected males is 0.10, or one in ten, we can use this information to calculate the expected frequency of affected females. Since the condition is X-linked recessive, the frequency of affected females can be calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg equation:\n\np^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1\n\nwhere p is the frequency of the normal (non-mutated) X chromosome, q is the frequency of the mutated X chromosome, and 2pq represents the frequency of heterozygous carriers.\n\nSince the condition is recessive, we can assume that the frequency of the normal X chromosome is 1-q. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(1-q)^2 + 2(1-q)q + q^2 = 1\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n1 - 2q + q^2 + 2q - 2q^2 + q^2 = 1\n\nwhich further simplifies to:\n\n2q^2 - 2q = 0\n\nFactoring out 2q, we get:\n\n2q(q - 1) = 0\n\nwhich means that either q = 0 (no mutated X chromosomes) or q = 1 (all X chromosomes are mutated). Since we know that the frequency of affected males is 0.10, we can assume that q = 0.1 (one in ten X chromosomes is mutated).\n\nTo calculate the expected frequency of affected females, we can plug in q = 0.1 into the Hardy-Weinberg equation:\n\n(1-0.1)^2 + 2(1-0.1)(0.1) + (0.1)^2 = 0.81\n\nTherefore, the expected frequency of affected females is 0.81.

Therefore, the expected frequency of affected females can be calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg equation, which is:\n\np^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1\n\nwhere p is the frequency of the normal X allele and q is the frequency of the affected X allele in the population. \n\nSince the frequency of affected males in the population is 0.10, q^2 = 0.10, and q = sqrt(0.10) = 0.316. Therefore, the frequency of the normal X allele is p = 1 - q = 0.684. \n\nTo calculate the frequency of affected females, we need to use the fact that they can only be affected if they inherit two copies of the affected X allele. The probability of inheriting an affected X allele from the mother is q, and the probability of inheriting another affected X allele from the father is also q, since affected males only pass on affected X alleles to their daughters. Therefore, the frequency of affected females is:\n\nq * q = q^2 = 0.10\n\nSo the expected frequency of affected females is 0.10, which is answer (C).", null, null], ["The question refers to an X-linked recessive condition, which means that the gene causing the condition is on the X chromosome. Since males only have one X chromosome, they will express the condition if they inherit the affected gene. Females, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes and must inherit two copies of the affected gene in order to express the condition. However, because the gene is recessive, females who inherit only one copy of the affected gene will be carriers of the condition but will not show symptoms.\n\nThe frequency of affected males in the population is given as 0.10 or one in ten. This means that 10% of males in the population are affected. Using this information, we can calculate the frequency of the affected gene in the population by the Hardy-Weinberg equation, which states that the frequency of the recessive gene is equal to the square root of the frequency of affected individuals. \n\nSo, the frequency of the recessive gene is sqrt(0.10) = 0.316.\n\nTo calculate the expected frequency of affected females, we use the Hardy-Weinberg equation again. We know that the frequency of carriers in the population is 2pq, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (not carrying the trait) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (carrying the trait).\n\nSince the frequency of the recessive allele is 0.316, the frequency of the dominant allele is 1 - 0.316 = 0.684.\n\nThus, the expected frequency of carriers in the population is 2pq = 2 x 0.684 x 0.316 = 0.433.\n\nFinally, the expected frequency of affected females can be calculated as q^2, where q is the frequency of the recessive allele.

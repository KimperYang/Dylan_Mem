Wage elasticity of demand refers to the responsiveness of the demand for labor to changes in wages. If the wage elasticity of demand is high, it means that a small change in wages would lead to a significant shift in the demand for labor. Due to this shift in labor demand, there will also be a change in the supply and prices of the goods produced by the labor. Hence, the greater the wage elasticity of demand, the greater the price elasticity for the product produced by labor. Therefore, the answer is (B).", null, null], ["The greater (higher) the wage elasticity of demand, the (B) greater the price elasticity for the product produced by labor. Wage elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of labor to a change in its wage rate. When wage elasticity of demand is high, a small change in the wage rate can lead to a large change in the quantity of labor demanded. This means that firms producing the good have little control over the wage rate without reducing their demand for labor. As a result, they may raise the price of their product to compensate for higher labor costs, leading to a greater price elasticity for the product produced by labor.", null, null]]
[["If the market price is above the perfectly competitive firm's average total cost curve, we expect that in the long run, the industry expands as firms enter the market. This is because firms are making a profit, which acts as an incentive for current firms to produce more and for new firms to enter the market. As the number of firms increases, the supply of the product will also increase, leading to a decrease in price. This decrease in price will continue until the price equals the average total cost, at which point firms will be making normal profits and will stop entering the market.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D). The industry expands as firms enter the market.", null, null], ["If the market price is above the perfectly competitive firm's average total cost curve, we expect that in the long run, the industry will expand as firms enter the market. This is because firms in the industry are making economic profits in the short run, which will attract new firms to enter the market. As more firms enter the market, the industry supply will increase, causing the market price to decrease. This decrease in price will continue until the price equals the average total cost for each firm in the industry, resulting in zero economic profit.

As a result, the market price will decrease, and the firms' profits will decrease. This will cause some firms to exit the market as they will no longer be making profits.

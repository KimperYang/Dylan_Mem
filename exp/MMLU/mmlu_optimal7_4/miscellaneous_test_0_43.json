[["Thank you for the question. As a lawyer with a background in economics, I will answer this question by first explaining some basic concepts related to the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System is responsible for implementing monetary policy in the United States. One of the tools it uses to do this is the discount rate, which is the interest rate at which member banks can borrow money from the Fed. When the Fed increases the discount rate, borrowing becomes more expensive for banks, so they are less likely to borrow and lend money to consumers. Conversely, when the Fed decreases the discount rate, banks can borrow more easily and lend money to consumers at lower rates, which can increase consumer spending.\n\nAnother tool the Fed uses is open market operations, which involve the buying and selling of government securities. When the Fed sells government securities, it takes money out of circulation and decreases the money supply, which can lead to less spending. When it buys securities, it injects money into the economy, which can lead to more spending.\n\nFinally, reserve requirements refer to the amount of money that member banks are required to keep on hand. When reserve requirements are increased, banks have less money available to lend to consumers, which can decrease spending.\n\nBased on these concepts, it is clear that the action most likely to increase consumer spending would be (B) Decreasing the discount rate to member banks. By making it easier for banks and consumers to borrow money at lower rates, the Fed can encourage more spending and investment in the economy.

This makes it easier for consumers to borrow money and encourages them to spend more. Increasing the discount rate has the opposite effect, making it more expensive for member banks to borrow and increasing the interest rates they charge consumers, which discourages spending.

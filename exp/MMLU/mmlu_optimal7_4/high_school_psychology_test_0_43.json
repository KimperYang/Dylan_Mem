In option B, the physiological need of hunger creates tension that motivates Ernest to eat cookies. In option C, the physiological need of hunger is already satisfied due to the large breakfast, so Tish does not feel any tension or motivation to eat lunch. In option D, Kezia's decision to order strawberry cheesecake despite being full could be explained by cognitive factors such as her desire to indulge or her belief that she will enjoy the dessert.\n\nTherefore, the option for which drive-reduction theories would not provide a reasonable explanation is C) Tish decides to skip lunch because she is still full from eating a very large breakfast.

Drive-reduction theories suggest that behavior is motivated by the desire to satisfy physiological needs and reduce tension or drive. In option (A), Jerome is driven by the physiological need of thirst, in option (B), Ernest is driven by hunger and in option (D), Kezia may be driven by a desire for pleasure or reward.

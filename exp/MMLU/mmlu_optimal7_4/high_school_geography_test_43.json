As population grows, the demand for more land for farming increases, leading to deforestation, soil degradation, and ultimately a decline in crop yields.

As population increases, farmers must clear more land, leading to deforestation and soil degradation. This can ultimately lead to food shortages, malnutrition, and famine. Additionally, without access to modern agricultural technologies and techniques, these societies may struggle to increase their crop yields enough to support their growing populations.\n\nIn contrast, an industrial society with abundant natural resources and large imports of food (option A) may experience challenges related to resource depletion or environmental degradation, but is unlikely to experience population pressure in the same way as a subsistence farming society. Similarly, a society with a highly mechanized agricultural sector (option B) may be able to increase crop yields to keep up with population growth, and a non-ecumene (option C) is by definition an area with very low population density. \n\nTherefore, based on these factors, I would argue that a slash-and-burn agricultural society is most likely to experience population pressure.

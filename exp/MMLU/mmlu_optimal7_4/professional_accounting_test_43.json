Fixed overhead and licensing fees are not relevant, as they will not change with the special order. \n\nThe additional revenue from the special order would be $1,000,000 ($200 selling price x 5000 units). However, shipping costs of $10 per unit would not apply to the special order, which would increase the contribution margin. \n\nUsing the contribution margin approach, the contribution margin per unit for the special order would be $90 ($200 selling price - $60 direct materials - $10 direct labor - $40 variable overhead), compared to the contribution margin per unit of $70 ($200 selling price - $60 direct materials - $10 direct labor - $40 variable overhead - $30 fixed overhead / 400000 units) for regular production. \n\nTo determine the lowest acceptable price for the special order, we should consider the contribution margin that Match would lose by selling to Reno instead of in the regular market. \n\nThus, the lowest price per unit at which Match should sell the 5000 units to Reno would be: \n\n$110 (relevant cost per unit) + $20 (difference in contribution margin) = $130 \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) $110.", "After examining each agent's solution and consulting my own expertise, I believe the most accurate answer to the question is (B) $140.\n\nFirstly, we need to calculate the relevant cost per unit for Match Co.

This means the licensing fee per unit is $50,000 / 400,000 units = $0.125 per unit.\n\nThe total cost to produce and sell 5,000 units to Reno Co. would be $110 per unit (relevant cost per unit) + $0.125 per unit (licensing fee per unit) = $110.125 per unit.\n\nTherefore, the lowest price per unit Match Co. should be willing to sell to Reno Co. is $110.125.

Option (C) $190 is too high as it is more than twice the relevant cost per unit and licensing fee. Option (D) $200 is the selling price for all 400,000 units and would not make sense to offer to Reno Co. for a special order.\n\nNow, evaluating the other agents' solutions:\n- Agent solution 1: I would score this solution 4 out of 5. The reasoning and calculation for the relevant cost per unit and contribution margin are correct and clear. However, the approach of adding the difference in contribution margin without calculating the licensing fee per unit is flawed.\n- Agent solution 2: I would score this solution 2 out of 5. Although the calculation for the relevant cost per unit and licensing fee per unit are correct, the approach of adding them together to get the lowest price per unit is not correct. It doesn't take into account the need to earn a profit.\n- Agent solution 3: I would score this solution 3 out of 5. The calculation for the cost per unit is correct, but the reasoning is not clear. The assumption that only the licensing fee needs to be recovered from the special order without earning a profit is not justifiable.\n- Agent solution 4: I would score this solution 1 out of 5. The calculation of the licensing fee per unit is correct, but the calculation of the relevant cost per unit is incorrect as it does not take into account the fixed overhead cost. Furthermore, the answer of $200 is incorrect as it does not consider any other factors beyond the relevant cost per unit. \n\nOverall, I believe my answer is the most accurate and well-reasoned among these solutions. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) $140. [[4, 2, 3, 1]]", null], ["As per the given scenario, Match Co. manufactures a product with a cost of $140 per unit and has a ready market for all 400,000 units at a selling price of $200 each. The selling costs consist of $10 per unit shipping and a fixed licensing fee of $50,000 per year.\n\nNow, Reno Co. wishes to buy 5,000 units on a special order with no shipping costs. We need to calculate the lowest price per unit that Match should be willing to sell to Reno.\n\nThe cost of manufacturing a unit is $140, and there are no shipping costs involved for the special order from Reno Co. The only additional cost would be the licensing fee, which Match Co. would need to recover from the sale of 5,000 units.\n\nThe licensing fee of $50,000 would be spread over the 400,000 units that Match Co. sells in the regular market. Therefore, the licensing fee per unit can be calculated as follows:\n\nLicensing fee per unit = Total licensing fee / Number of units sold in the regular market\n\nLicensing fee per unit = $50,000 / 400,000 units\n\nLicensing fee per unit = $0.125 per unit\n\nNow, the total cost incurred by Match Co. for producing 5,000 units (excluding licensing fee) is calculated as follows:\n\nTotal cost per unit = Direct materials + Direct labor + Variable overhead + (Fixed overhead / Number of units produced)\n\nTotal cost per unit = $60 + $10 + $40 + ($30 / 400,000 units)\n\nTotal cost per unit = $110.075 per unit\n\nTherefore, Match Co. should be willing to sell 5,000 units to Reno Co. at a price of at least $110.075 per unit to cover the cost of manufacturing. However, Match Co. needs to recover the licensing fee as well. So, the lowest price per unit at which Match should be willing to sell 5,000 units to Reno is:\n\nPrice per unit = Total cost per unit + Licensing fee per unit\n\nPrice per unit = $110.075 + $0.125\n\nPrice per unit = $110.20\n\nThus, the answer is (D) $200.", "First, we need to find the relevant cost per unit for the 5000 units that Reno Co. wants to buy. The relevant cost per unit includes only the direct materials, direct labor, and variable overhead costs, as they will be incurred regardless of whether the units are sold to the ready market or the special order. Thus, the relevant cost per unit is:\n\nDirect materials + Direct labor + Variable overhead = $60 + $10 + $40 = $110\n\nOption (A) $110 is the lowest price per unit at which Match should be willing to sell the 5000 units to Reno if Match only wants to cover its relevant costs. Option (D) $200 is the selling price for all 400,000 units in the ready market and is not relevant for this special order.\n\nNow, we need to consider the licensing fee and the contribution margin. The licensing fee of $50,000 per year is a fixed cost and is not relevant to the decision of whether to accept the special order or not. However, if Match proceeds with the special order, it would not have to pay $10 per unit in shipping costs, which means that the contribution margin per unit for the special order would be higher than that for the ready market.\n\nUsing the contribution margin approach, the contribution margin per unit for the ready market is:\n\nContribution margin per unit = Selling price - Relevant cost per unit - Shipping costs per unit\nContribution margin per unit = $200 - $60 - $10 - $10 = $120\n\nThe contribution margin per unit for the special order is:\n\nContribution margin per unit = Selling price - Relevant cost per unit\nContribution margin per unit = $200 - $60 - $10 - $40 = $90\n\nThe difference in contribution margin per unit between the ready market and the special order is $120 - $90 = $30.\n\nTo determine the lowest price per unit at which Match should be willing to sell the 5000 units to Reno, we should consider the contribution margin that Match would lose by selling to Reno instead of in the ready market. Match should be willing to sell the 5000 units if the total contribution margin from the special order is higher than that from the ready market. \n\nTotal contribution margin from the ready market is:\n\nContribution margin per unit x Number of units in the ready market = $120 x 395000 = $47,400,000\n\nTotal contribution margin from the special order is:\n\nContribution margin per unit x Number of units in the special order = $90 x 5000 = $450,000\n\nThus, the total contribution margin from the ready market is higher than that from the special order by $47,400,000 - $450,000 = $46,950,000.\n\nIf Match accepts the special order, it would lose $46,950,000 in contribution margin from the ready market. To compensate for this loss, Match should increase the price per unit for the special order by $46,950,000 / 5000 units = $9,390 per unit. \n\nTherefore, the lowest price per unit at which Match should be willing to sell the 5000 units to Reno is:\n\nRelevant cost per unit + Additional cost per unit = $110 + $9,390 = $9,500\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer should be None of the Above. \n\nAgent solution 1: Score 2 - The solution is incorrect because it does not consider the contribution margin from the ready market and therefore does not provide a complete analysis of the situation.\n\nAgent solution 2: Score 1 - The solution assumes that fixed overhead costs are irrelevant, which is incorrect.

This means that for all 400,000 units sold, Match Co.'s total revenue and total costs would be:\n\nTotal Revenue = 400,000 units x $200 per unit = $80,000,000\nTotal Cost = (400,000 units x $110 per unit) + $50,000 licensing fee = $44,050,000\n\nNow, Reno Co. wants to purchase 5,000 units on a special order. Without any shipping costs, the cost per unit to Match Co. would still be $110. However, to ensure that this special order is profitable, Match Co. must cover its fixed costs (i.e. the licensing fee) and earn some profit. \n\nTo cover the licensing fee, Match Co. would need to charge Reno Co. $50,000/5,000 units = $10 per unit.

Reno Co. is requesting a special order of 5,000 units with no shipping costs.\n\nTo calculate the lowest price per unit, we need to consider the relevant costs. Since direct materials, direct labor, and variable overhead costs are all variable costs and will be incurred for each unit produced, regardless of whether it is for the ready market or the special order, the relevant cost per unit for Match is $110. Fixed overhead costs and licensing fees are not relevant to the decision. \n\nTherefore, the lowest price per unit at which Match should be willing to sell the 5,000 units to Reno  is $110, so the answer is (A) $110.\n\nAgent solution 1: The agent seems to have made an error in adding the licensing fee per unit, resulting in a conclusion that Match Co. should be willing to sell the 5,000 units to Reno at a higher price.

However, the licensing fee is a common cost and is not relevant to this decision. Therefore, we do not need to calculate this cost.\n\nUsing the relevant cost per unit, we can determine the lowest price per unit at which Match Co. should be willing to sell the 5,000 units to Reno.

To answer this, we need to understand what AMT tax preference items are. \n\nAMT stands for Alternative Minimum Tax, which is an alternative way of calculating tax liability for certain individuals and corporations with high deductions.

However, under AMT, the entire amount of long-term capital gain is taxed as a preference item. Therefore, $15,000 is added to West's taxable income as a preference item. \n\nPercentage depletion is a tax deduction available to businesses that extract natural resources. If the percentage depletion exceeds the property's adjusted basis, it becomes a preference item under AMT.

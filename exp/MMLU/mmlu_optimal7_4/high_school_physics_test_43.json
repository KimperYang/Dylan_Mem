The coefficient of friction and the surface material remain constant, and the normal force depends on the weight of the block and the gravitational force acting on it. The gravitational force is proportional to the weight of the block, and the weight is proportional to the product of the height, length, and width of the block.

This effect occurs with all waves, including sound waves. When the sound source and the observer are moving towards each other, the wavelength of the sound waves emitted by the source is compressed, and the frequency of the sound waves received by the observer is higher, resulting in a perceived increase in pitch.

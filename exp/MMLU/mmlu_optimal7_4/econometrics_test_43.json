Diagnostic testing allows the researcher to refine the model by checking for relevant indicators.\n\n(ii) The diagnostic testing in the Box-Jenkins approach involves checking the model residuals for three main characteristics; autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity, and non-normality.

[["The most valid way to produce a 10-day forecast of volatility would be (B) Produce 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 step ahead conditional variance forecasts and add them up and take the square root.

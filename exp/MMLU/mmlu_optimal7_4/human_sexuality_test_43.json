[["The answer is (D) b and c. Let's break down each option. Option (A) psychological refers to the study of behavior and mental processes.

Option (C) statistical refers to the use of statistical methods to analyze data and draw conclusions. There are several statistical methods that can be used to define what is considered \"normal\" or \"deviant.\" However, none of them are perfect as they are based on societal values and norms.

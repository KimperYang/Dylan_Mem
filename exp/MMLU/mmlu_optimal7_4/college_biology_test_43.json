Green unicellular algae, on the other hand, are eukaryotic organisms that have a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Both cyanobacteria and green unicellular algae produce oxygen through photosynthesis, but the mechanisms and structures involved in their photosynthesis are different. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).", null, null], ["The correct answer is C) Cyanobacteria have no nuclei. While both cyanobacteria and green unicellular algae are photosynthetic organisms and can perform oxygenic photosynthesis, they differ in their genetic makeup. Cyanobacteria lack a true nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, while green unicellular algae have both of these structures. Choice A) is incorrect because both cyanobacteria and green algae can reduce sulfur compounds. Choice B) is incorrect because cyanobacteria do have cell walls made of peptidoglycan, while green algae have cell walls made of cellulose. Choice D) is incorrect because both cyanobacteria and green algae produce cell membranes. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).", null, null], ["As a psychologist, my area of expertise lies in human behavior and mental processes, and not in taxonomy or biology.

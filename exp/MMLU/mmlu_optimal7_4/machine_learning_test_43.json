We need to consider the correlation between the feature and the outcome, as well as any potential collinearity with other features. If the feature is highly correlated with the outcome variable, we should retain it even if it has a negative coefficient. On the other hand, if the feature is not strongly correlated with the outcome variable, we may want to remove it for the sake of simplicity and interpretability of the model.\n\nI think Agent solution 1 oversimplifies the issue by assuming that a high negative coefficient always implies that the feature should be retained.

[[null, null, null], ["First of all, if write-allocation is always used, then every write-miss will allocate a cache line and the data will be loaded into the cache. Therefore, the choice between write-through and write-back policies will mostly affect the cache eviction strategy and the percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation.\n\nIn general, a write-back policy is expected to result in a better hit ratio than a write-through policy, because it allows more flexibility in choosing which dirty lines to evict from the cache. When a dirty line is evicted from the cache in a write-through policy, it must be immediately written back to main memory, even if it is unlikely to be re-used soon. This can cause unnecessary main memory traffic and decrease the hit ratio.\n\nOn the other hand, a write-through policy ensures that the main memory always has an up-to-date copy of the data, which can be important in some systems where data consistency is critical. However, if write-allocation is used, then every write-miss will still result in a cache line being loaded and, eventually, written back to main memory, regardless of the write policy.\n\nAs for the percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation, it is not clear which policy will always result in a smaller percentage. It depends on the access patterns and the sizes of the cache and main memory. However, it is worth noting that a write-back policy can delay the main memory updates and accumulate several changes in the cache before writing them back, potentially reducing the number of main memory operations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Write-back usually results in a better hit ratio than write-through.", null, null], ["As write-allocation is always used, a write-miss will allocate and load a cache line.

This is because with write-back, data is only written to main memory when a cache line is evicted, so multiple writes to the same line can be consolidated. On the other hand, write-through policy incurs the overhead of immediately writing changes to main memory for every write operation. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Write-back usually results in a better hit ratio than write-through.", null, null], ["For optimal cache performance, it is desirable to maximize the hit ratio, which is the percentage of accesses for which data are found in the cache.

This can be beneficial in reducing main memory traffic and improving hit ratio.

Therefore, (A) Write-back usually results in a better hit ratio than write-through. is true.\n \n(C) The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-back than for write-through because write-back can delay updating main memory until a cache line is evicted, while write-through performs an immediate update to main memory with each write operation.

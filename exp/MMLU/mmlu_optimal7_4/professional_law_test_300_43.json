The President cannot unilaterally cancel a law passed by Congress. Executive orders must be within the scope of the President's constitutional powers and should not violate existing laws or the Constitution. (C)", null, null], ["The executive order that will most likely be found unconstitutional is option (A) - The President issued an executive order requiring all executive branch employees to use exclusively one brand of ballpoint pens and pencils as their writing utensils. \n\nThe reason for this is that the President does not have the authority to issue an executive order that infringes on the rights of individuals without a legitimate government interest. Requiring all employees to use a specific brand of pens and pencils does not serve a legitimate government interest and is therefore unconstitutional.\n\nOption (B) - The President issued an executive order requiring all executive branch employees to wear only white shirts and blouses during regular working hours - could also be considered unconstitutional as it may be seen as a violation of employees' freedom of expression and personal style. However, if the dress code is related to safety or uniformity, it may be considered constitutional.\n\nOption (C) - The President executes an executive decree abrogating the Commission of Birdwatchers - could be seen as a valid exercise of the President's powers and within their authority, unless the Commission is protected by statute or the Constitution.\n\nOption (D) - The President issues an executive decree authorizing U. S. Army troops to the island to provide medical and humanitarian assistance - is likely constitutional under the President's authority to respond to emergencies and protect national security.", null, null], ["The executive order that is most likely to be found unconstitutional is option (C), where the President executes an executive decree abrogating the Commission of Birdwatchers. This is because the Commission was established by an act of Congress, and as such, only Congress can abolish it. The President does not have the authority to override a law passed by Congress, and any attempt to do so would be a violation of the separation of powers outlined in the Constitution. Therefore, this executive order would likely be found unconstitutional. (C)", null, null]]

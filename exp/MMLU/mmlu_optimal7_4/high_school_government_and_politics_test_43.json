Locke was an English philosopher who believed that all individuals are equal and have natural rights that include life, liberty, and property. He argued that people form governments to protect these rights and that if a government fails to do so, the people have the right to overthrow it. These ideas were influential in the writing of the Declaration of Independence, which states that all men are created equal and have the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

[["The correct answer is (B). Political scientists identify the presidential elections of Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 and Richard Nixon in 1968, as well as the midterm election of 1994 as \"critical elections\" mainly because those elections saw major shifts in party alignment that would last for decades. In 1932, with the country in the depths of the Great Depression, Roosevelt and the Democrats won a landslide victory and ushered in an era of Democratic dominance that lasted for 20 years. Similarly, in 1968, Nixon and the Republicans won a close contest that marked the beginning of a new era of Republican dominance.

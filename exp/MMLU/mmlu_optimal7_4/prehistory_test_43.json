This allowed for the development of the large human brain despite the constraints of bipedalism on the female pelvis. Option (A) is incorrect because the brain size of hominids has grown through evolution, and modern human babies have heads that are still too large to walk at birth. Option (B) is incorrect because the secondary altricial condition of modern human babies actually delays independence from the mother. Option (D) is incorrect because the modern human birth canal is actually narrower than that of our ancestors. Therefore, the correct answer is (C).", null, null], ["The answer is (C) it allowed for subsequent growth of the brain, since bipedalism had resulted in a narrowed birth canal in the female pelvis. The secondarily altricial condition of modern human babies, meaning that they are born in a relatively undeveloped state and require extensive care and nurturing from their parents, is advantageous for the growth and development of their large brains. This is because bipedalism caused a narrowing of the female pelvis, making it difficult for the baby to be born with fully developed brains. By being born in a less developed state, the baby's brain can continue to grow and develop outside of the womb, with the help of parental care and interaction. Choice (C) is the most accurate answer.", null, null], ["I believe the answer is D) it allowed for growth of the brain to nearly adult size prior to birth, since bipedalism had resulted in a wider birth canal in the female pelvis. This theory is known as the obstetrical dilemma, which suggests that the human pelvis is wide enough to allow the passage of a developed fetus with a large brain, but narrow enough to allow for efficient bipedal walking. This adaptation allowed for the development of larger brain sizes while still being able to walk upright. (D)", null, null]]
[["The answer is (A) finely crafted large jade disks called bi, which represent elite status and were found in some of the burials at the principal Liangzhu site in eastern China. These disks were believed to be symbols of power and were reserved for the highest levels of society. They were often placed in elaborate tombs alongside other precious objects, such as beautiful pottery, polished stone tools, and ornate jewelry. The presence of these disks suggests that the individuals buried with them were members of the Liangzhu elite, who controlled the region during the late Neolithic Period. Therefore, the answer is (A) finely crafted large jade disks called bi.", null, null], ["Based on my knowledge of ancient Chinese history and burial customs, I believe that the answer is (A) finely crafted large jade disks called bi. Jade was highly valued in Chinese culture and was often associated with wealth and prestige. It was a common practice to include jade artifacts in the burials of high-ranking officials and members of the elite class. The bi were specifically large circular disks that were intricately carved and polished, and were often used as ceremonial objects. Therefore, (A) is the best representation of elite status found in the burials at the principal Liangzhu site in eastern China.", null, null], ["Yes, I can answer the question.

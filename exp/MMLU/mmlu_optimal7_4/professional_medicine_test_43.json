Additionally, the patient's leukocyte count is elevated, which can be a result of this syndrome. While illicit drug use and excessive drinking may have played a role in this patient's overall health, the presentation of symptoms points more towards neuroleptic malignant syndrome than amphetamine intoxication or delirium tremens.

Delirium tremens can cause confusion and agitation but is typically associated with tremors and hallucinations.

Delirium tremens may be a consideration due to the patient's history of alcohol abuse, but the presentation of muscle rigidity and elevated serum creatine kinase activity make it less likely.

[["Given her symptoms, medical history, and physical exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is diverticulitis.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is indicated for diagnosis of pancreatic or biliary disease, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms.

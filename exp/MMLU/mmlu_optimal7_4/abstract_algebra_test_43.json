In general, a free group on a set S is the group of all words (alternating elements and their inverses) that can be formed from the elements of S. An abelian group is simply a group where the operation is commutative. So a free abelian group on a set S is the group of all linear combinations (with integer coefficients) of the elements of S, where addition is the group operation. \n\nNow, a torsion element in a group is an element that has finite order. That is, there exists some positive integer n such that when you add the element to itself n times, you get the identity element of the group. A group is torsion-free if it has no torsion elements. \n\nSo why is every free abelian group torsion-free? Suppose we have a non-zero element a in our free abelian group, and suppose that a has order n. That is, na = 0 (where 0 is the identity element of the group). If we write a as a linear combination of the elements of S (which we can do since our group is free abelian), we can view na as a linear combination of the elements of S with integer coefficients all multiplied by n. But if this linear combination equals 0, then we can cancel the factor of n (since our group is free, there is no other way to get the sum to be 0), and we would get a non-trivial linear combination of the elements of S that sums to 0.

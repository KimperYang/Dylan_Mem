This means that China's GDP per capita had increased by 32 times from 1950 to 2016.

Here's my reasoning:\n\nAccording to the World Bank, China's GDP per capita in 1950 was $439.38 in current US dollars, and in 2016 it was $8,123.86.

Dividing the 2016 price level index by the 1950 price level index gives us a multiplier of 25.58.\n\nMultiplying the 1950 GDP per capita value by the price level index gives us the 1950 GDP per capita in 2016 prices: \n\n$439.38 x 25.58 = $11,233.8\n\nDividing the 2016 GDP per capita value by the adjusted 1950 GDP per capita value gives us the fold increase in GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016:\n\n$8,123.86 / $11,233.8 = 0.723 or 72.3%\n\nHowever, this calculation does not take into account the compounding effect of growth over time.

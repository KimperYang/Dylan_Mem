Although the parties to the dispute have no connection with Delaware, the choice-of-law provision is included in the contract and there is no indication that it violates public policy. The fact that the independent distributor conducted most of his business in California and that the manufacturer was based in Illinois is not a reason to reject the choice-of-law provision. Therefore, the presiding state court would likely adhere to the choice-of-law provision and apply Delaware law. \n\nScores: \nAgent 1: 4\nAgent 2: 3\nAgent 3: 4\nAgent 4: 2\n\nFinal Scores: [[4, 3, 4, 2]]", null]]
[["The correct answer is (C). The fact that an accident occurred does not automatically mean that the hospital was negligent. Without any evidence of specific conduct or neglect on the hospital's part that caused the doors to malfunction, the patient cannot prove that the hospital was at fault. Additionally, the nurse's action of pulling the wheelchair back through the doors could be considered a superseding cause of the injury, relieving the hospital of liability. Therefore, the court should grant the hospital's motion for summary judgment. (C)", null, null], ["Choice C is the correct answer. Just because an accident occurred, it does not necessarily mean that someone was negligent.

The nurse's action may have been the immediate cause of the injury, but that does not necessarily mean that the hospital was negligent. (C)", null, null], ["I believe the answer is (C) Yes, because proof of an accident, by itself, does not establish that an injured person was a victim of negligence. The patient in this case has not presented any evidence of negligence on the part of the hospital, and the mere fact of the accident does not automatically make the hospital liable. The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which suggests that negligence can be inferred from the mere occurrence of an accident under certain circumstances, may not apply here because the patient has not shown that the accident was caused by anything under the hospital's control. Additionally, the nurse's attempt to pull the wheelchair back through the doors could be seen as a superseding cause of the injury, further diminishing the hospital's responsibility. Therefore, the court should grant the hospital's motion for summary judgment.

[["In this case, the professor is being accused of defamation by the law school graduate for stating that he cheated to obtain a grade.

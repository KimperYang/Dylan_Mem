We want to find all positive integer values of $n$ that satisfy this equation.\n\nFirst, we prime factorize $1200$ into $2^4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$.

Substituting this into $1200 = k \\cdot n^2$ gives $75 = k \\cdot m^2$.\n\nThus, $75$ must be divisible by $k$, which means that $k$ must be a factor of $75$. The prime factorization of $75$ is $3 \\cdot 5^2$, so the possible values of $k$ are $1$, $3$, $5$, $15$, $25$, $75$. \n\nFor each value of $k$, we solve for $m$ to obtain $n = 2m$, and then we sum all of the possible values of $n$. \n\nWhen $k=1$, we have $75 = m^2$. The only positive integer solutions for $m$ are $m=5$ and $m=-5$. However, $n$ must be positive, so $m=-5$ is not a valid solution. Thus, when $k=1$, $n=2 \\cdot 5 = 10$. \nWhen $k=3$, we have $25 = m^2$, which gives $m=\\pm 5$. Thus, $n=2 \\cdot 5 = 10$ and $n = 2 \\cdot (-5) = -10$ are possible solutions, but we only consider positive values of $n$, so $k=3$ yields no valid solutions. \nWhen $k=5$, we have $15 = m^2$, which has no integer solutions for $m$. Thus, $k=5$ also yields no valid solutions. \nWhen $k=15$, we have $5 = m^2$, which has no integer solutions for $m$. Thus, $k=15$ yields no valid solutions. \nWhen $k=25$, we have $3 = m^2$, which has no integer solutions for $m$. Thus, $k=25$ yields no valid solutions. \nWhen $k=75$, we have $1 = m^2$, which gives $m=1$ or $m=-1$. Thus, $n=2 \\cdot 1 = 2$ and $n=2 \\cdot (-1) = -2$ are possible solutions, but we only consider positive values of $n$, so the only valid solution for $k=75$ is $n=2$. \n\nSumming all possible values of $n$, we get $10+2=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }42}$.", "To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that $n^2$ is a factor of 1200.

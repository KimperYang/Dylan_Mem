Then, it sorts the list first by length, then alphabetically. This is done by passing a lambda function as the key argument to the list's sort method. The lambda function returns a tuple for each string - the first element is the string's length, and the second element is the string itself. When sorting, Python will compare these tuples. If the lengths are the same for two strings, it will then compare the strings themselves, resulting in alphabetical sorting for strings of the same length.", "```python\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function accepts a list of strings as a parameter,\n    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,\n    and returns the resulted list in a sorted order.\n    The order of the list is ascending by length of each word,\n    and if two words have the same length, the list is sorted alphabetically.\n    The function returns a list of strings in sorted order.\n\n    :param lst: list of strings\n    :return: sorted list of strings (with even length)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Filter the list to only include strings of even length\n    even_length_strings = [s for s in lst if len(s) % 2 == 0]\n\n    # Sort the list by the length of the string and then alphabetically\n    sorted_list = sorted(even_length_strings, key=lambda s: (len(s), s))\n\n    return sorted_list\n```\n\nThe previous implementations are already correct. They use list comprehension to filter out the strings with odd lengths and then sort the remaining strings first by their lengths and then alphabetically. The score for the Syntax Checker, Unit Tests and Reflector are [[4, 4, 5]], respectively. The Syntax Checker and Unit Tests worked as expected but the Reflector was especially helpful in understanding the logic behind the implementations.", null], [null, null, null], [null, null, null], [null, null, null], [null, null, null]]
